You'll start by\nunderstanding how programming languages represent data and how to choose the right types for the job. From there, you\nwill practise guiding your programs with conditional logic and loops before closing with a tour of the most common data\nstructures used in everyday development.\n\nBy the end, you'll be able to read and write simple programs, reason about how data moves through them, and feel ready to\ndive into more advanced topics."

Completing the course equips you with the mental models needed for further study in analysis,\nphysics, and beyond."
