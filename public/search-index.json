Content types and their roles\n\n### 1.1 Subjects\n\n**File location:** `src/content/subjects/`  \n**Purpose:** High-level domains (e.g. `mathematics`, `physics`).  \n**Frontmatter (typical):**\n\n- `id: string` (usually matches the slug)\n- `title: string`\n- Optional labels, summary, tags\n\nSubjects rarely change. Most authors never touch these.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Macro-courses\n\n**File location:** `src/content/macro-courses/`  \n**Purpose:** Big arcs inside a subject (e.g. `math-calculus`).  \n**Frontmatter (typical):**\n\n- `id: string` (e.g. `math-calculus`)\n- `subject: \"mathematics\"`\n- `title: string`\n- Optional `description`, `order`, `tags`\n\nCourses attach to these via `macroId`.\n\n---\n\n### 1.3 Courses\n\n**File location:** `src/content/courses/`  \n**Purpose:** Concrete course units (e.g. `math-calculus-limits`).  \n\n**Frontmatter (canonical):**\n\n- `id: string` — **required**, used as the anchor ID  \n  - Example: `math-calculus-limits`\n- `subject: string` — **required**  \n  - Example: `mathematics`\n- `macroId?: string` — preferred  \n  - Example: `math-calculus`\n- `title: string`\n- `description?: string`\n- `order?: number` — ordering within the macro-course\n- `tags?: string[]`\n\nAll **lessons**, **concepts**, and **exercises** in a vertical should agree on `courseId`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. IDs and naming conventions\n\nUse **stable, descriptive IDs** that are:\n\n- Lowercase\n- Hyphen-separated\n- Namespaced by subject / course\n\nPatterns:\n\n- **Course IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits`, `math-analysis-sequences-limits`\n- **Concept IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits-informal-idea`  \n  `math-calculus-limits-continuity-interval`\n- **Lesson IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-01`  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-05-epsilon-delta`\n- **Exercise set IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-01-exercises`  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-05-epsilon-delta-exercises`\n\nOnce an `id` ships, **do not rename** it. Instead:\n\n- Keep the `id` stable.\n- Change only `title`, `summary`, or content.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Math syntax and LaTeX rules\n\nThe math pipeline is MDX → remark → KaTeX. Authoring rules:\n\n### 3.1 Allowed math syntaxes\n\n- **Inline math** — use single `$`:\n\n  ```md\n  The function $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous."

    "content": "## Snapshot\n\nLimit computation often reduces to transforming an expression into one where the\nalgebraic limit laws apply directly. Typical techniques include substitution,\nfactoring and canceling terms, rationalization using conjugates, and isolating\ndominant terms. These methods resolve indeterminate forms and reveal the true\nbehavior of the function near the limit point.\n\n## Formal Statement\n\nThere is no single theorem; instead, this concept groups a set of algebraic\nprocedures that are valid when:\n\n1. The rewritten expression is **algebraically equivalent** to the original for\n   all $x$ in a punctured neighborhood of the limit point.\n2. The rewritten form yields a limit that exists and is finite (or infinite,\n   when analyzing asymptotic behavior).\n\nThe main strategies are:\n\n1. **Direct substitution** when the expression is well-defined.  \n2. **Factoring and canceling common factors** to resolve $0/0$ forms.  \n3. **Rationalizing numerator or denominator** using conjugates.  \n4. **Common denominators** for sums of rational expressions.  \n5. **Dominant-term comparison** for polynomial and rational functions.  \n6. **Algebraic isolation** (adding/subtracting the same term, multiplying by 1).  \n\n## Intuition & Interpretation\n\nLimit computation is fundamentally about revealing the structure of a function\nnear a point. Indeterminate forms obscure that structure by hiding critical\ncancellations or symmetries. Algebraic simplifications make the underlying\nbehavior explicit so that limit laws can be applied reliably.\n\nThe key idea is to replace the original expression by an equivalent one that is\nsimpler *in a neighborhood of the point*, not necessarily at the point itself.\n\n## Examples & Non-Examples\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Factoring to resolve $0/0$**\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}\n= \\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}\n= \\lim_{x\\to 2} (x+2)\n= 4.\n$$\n\n2. **Rationalizing a numerator** (multiply by the conjugate)\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sqrt{x+1} - 1}{x}\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{(\\sqrt{x+1}-1)(\\sqrt{x+1}+1)}{x(\\sqrt{x+1}+1)}\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{x}{x(\\sqrt{x+1}+1)}\n= \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+1}+1}\n= \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\n3. **Dominant-term for rational functions**\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} \\frac{3x^2 - 4x + 1}{6x^2 + 5}\n= \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\n4. **Direct substitution** (no simplification needed)\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 1} (3x^2 + 2) = 5.\n$$\n\n### Non-Examples (Incorrect Uses)\n\n1. **Canceling when factorization is not valid**  \n$$\n\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = x + 1 \\quad \\text{only for } x\\neq 1.\n$$\nDirect substitution on the **unsimplified** form still fails at $x=1$.\n\n2. **Using dominant-term rules when degrees mismatch subtly**  \nFor\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{x^2 + x}{x^2 - x^3},\n$$\nthe denominator grows faster with sign changes; equal-degree comparison does not apply.\n\n3. **Rationalizing incorrectly**  \nMultiplying numerator and denominator by *different* conjugates introduces a non‑equivalent expression.\n\n4. **Assuming simplification must match value at the point**  \nEquivalence is required on a **punctured neighborhood**; the value at the point may differ.\n\n## Properties & Relationships\n\n- Simplification often converts an indeterminate form to one where limit laws apply.\n- Reveals **removable discontinuities**, connecting to continuity.\n- Dominant-term methods relate to **limits at infinity**.\n- Algebraic simplification is often a precursor to using the **squeeze theorem**.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n1. Demanding equivalence at the point (unnecessary).  \n2. Hiding domain restrictions after canceling.  \n3. Misidentifying $0/0$ vs divergence.  \n4. Applying dominant-term rules when lower-degree terms control behavior locally.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1. **Compute**\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 3} \\frac{x^2 - 9}{x-3}.\n$$\n\n2. **Rationalization** — Evaluate\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 4} \\frac{\\sqrt{x} - 2}{x-4}.\n$$\n\n3. **Dominant terms** — Compute\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{5x^3 - x}{10x^3 + 7}.\n$$\n\n4. **Conceptual** — Why can’t factorization help with\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1}{x}\\,?\n$$\n\n5. **Mini-proof (Sketch)** — Explain why algebraic equivalence on a punctured\nneighborhood preserves the limit."

The chosen $\\delta$ may depend on $\\varepsilon$\n(and on $f$), but once fixed it must work for **all** $x$ with $0<|x-a|<\\delta$.\n\n## Examples (Conceptual)\n\n1. **Constant function**  \nFor $f(x)=c$,\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = c\n$$\nis immediate since $|f(x)-c|=0$.\n\n2. **Linear function**  \nFor $f(x)=mx+b$,\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)=ma+b,\\quad |f(x)-(ma+b)|=|m||x-a|,\n\\quad \\delta=\\varepsilon/|m|\\ (m\\ne 0).\n$$\n\n3. **Limit without function value**  \nThe limit can exist even if $f(a)$ is undefined or $\\ne L$.\n\n## Quantifier Structure\n$$\n\\forall \\varepsilon > 0,\\ \\exists \\delta > 0,\\ \\forall x,\\ \n\\big( 0 < |x - a| < \\delta \\ \\Rightarrow\\ |f(x) - L| < \\varepsilon \\big).\n$$\nOrder matters: the universal $\\varepsilon$ is **outside** the existential $\\delta$.\n\n## Relationship to Informal Limits\n\n“$f(x)$ approaches $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$” is made precise by the\nepsilon–delta condition: $\\varepsilon$ measures output closeness; $\\delta$\ndescribes input closeness that guarantees it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Wrong quantifier order** (`\\exists\\delta \\forall\\varepsilon`)—not equivalent.  \n2. **$\\delta$ depending on $x$** — Once chosen, it must work for all $x$ in $0<|x-a|<\\delta$.  \n3. **Including $x=a$** — The punctured condition is essential.  \n4. **Misunderstanding $L$** — The statement asserts properties of a candidate $L$.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1. Translate the definition to plain language.  \n2. For $f(x)=5$, verify directly that\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 2} f(x) = 5.\n$$\n3. For $f(x)=3x-1$, outline an $\\varepsilon$–$\\delta$ proof that\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 2} f(x) = 5.\n$$\n4. Give an example where the definition fails for any $L$ and explain which part breaks."

Let $N$ be **between** $f(a)$ and $f(b)$:\n$$\nf(a) < N < f(b) \\quad\\text{or}\\quad f(b) < N < f(a).\n$$\nThen there exists $c\\in(a,b)$ with\n$$\nf(c) = N.\n$$\nThis is an **existence** result (no formula for $c$ is guaranteed).\n\n## Intuition & Interpretation\n\nContinuity forbids jumps or gaps on $[a,b]$, so traversing from $f(a)$ to $f(b)$\nmust cross every intermediate level. Closedness ensures the function is defined\nat both endpoints.\n\n## Examples & Non-Examples\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Root existence**\n$$\nf(x)=x^3-x-1,\\quad f(1)=-1,\\ f(2)=5 \\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\exists\\,c\\in(1,2)\\ \\text{s.t.}\\ f(c)=0.\n$$\n\n2. **Cross a horizontal level**  \nIf $f(0)=2,\\ f(4)=10$, then for any $N\\in(2,10)$ there exists $c\\in(0,4)$ with $f(c)=N$.\n\n3. **Trigonometric continuity** — Since $\\sin x$ is continuous, every value in $[-1,1]$ is achieved on intervals of length $\\pi$.\n\n### Non-Examples\n\n1. **Discontinuous function**\n$$\nf(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n-1,& x<0,\\\\\n1,& x\\ge0,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nskips values; IVT does not apply.\n\n2. **Open interval only** — On $(0,1)$ the endpoint may be undefined; IVT’s hypothesis fails.\n\n3. **Target value not between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$** — IVT gives no guarantee.\n\n## Properties & Relationships\n\n- Consequence of continuity on a closed interval.  \n- Supports proofs of root existence, sign-change arguments, and fixed points ($f(x)=x$).  \n- Solutions may be multiple or unique depending on function shape.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n1. Applying IVT without confirming continuity.  \n2. Using endpoints incorrectly when not defined.  \n3. Assuming IVT gives location/uniqueness (it doesn’t).  \n4. Forgetting “between” really means *between*.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1. **Sign change** — Show $x^5 - 6x + 1 = 0$ has a real root.  \n2. **Endpoint behavior** — If $f(0)=-4,\\ f(3)=-2$, does IVT guarantee $f(x)=0$?  \n3. **Existence only** — For $f(x)=\\cos x - x$, show a root lies in $(0,1)$.  \n4. **Mini‑proof** — Why is continuity only on $(a,b)$ not enough for the full IVT statement?"

Overview\n\nThis lesson establishes intuition and foundational language for limits:\n\n- What it means for a function to **approach** a value.  \n- How numerical and graphical evidence support limit reasoning.  \n- How to read and interpret standard limit notation.  \n\nIt prepares the formalism needed for algebraic limit rules and continuity.\n\n---\n\n# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson\n\n**Concept relationships:**\n\n- `informal-idea` → defines approaching behavior.  \n- `graphical-numerical` → operationalizes the informal idea using tables/plots.  \n- `notation` → encodes the concept precisely.\n\n**Dependency chain:**\n\nfunctions-basic → informal-idea  \ninformal-idea → graphical-numerical  \ninformal-idea → notation\n\n---\n\n# 3. Core Exposition\n\n## 3.1 Informal meaning of a limit\n\nA limit describes **behavior near** a point:\n- We do not care about the value *at* the point (it may not even be defined).  \n- We track what values the function produces when inputs are **close enough** to a target value.  \n\nA stable target behavior suggests a single “approach value.”\n\n## 3.2 Numerical evidence\n\nIf evaluating a function near $ a $ yields values concentrating near $ L $, we assert:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L.\n$$\n\nThe pattern matters, not the exact function value at $ a $.\n\n## 3.3 Graphical evidence\n\nGraphs support the same idea:\n- analyze the curve as it nears $ x=a $ from both sides,  \n- observe whether the $ y $-values converge to a single height.\n\n## 3.4 Standard limit notation\n\nForms:\n\n- $ \\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L $  \n- $ x \\to a^- $ and $ x \\to a^+ $ for one-sided limits  \n- “$ f(x) $ tends to $ L $” is verbal shorthand\n\nInterpretation requires connecting notation back to behavior.\n\n---\n\n# 4. Worked Examples\n\n### Example 1 — Numerical concentration\nConsider $ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} $. Table near $ x=1 $:\n\n| x | f(x) |\n|---|------|\n|0.9|1.9|\n|0.99|1.99|\n|1.01|2.01|\n|1.1|2.1|\n\nValues cluster near 2 → $ \\lim_{x\\to1} f(x)=2 $.\n\n### Example 2 — Graph-based inference\nGiven a plotted curve with a hole at $ (3, 5) $, but approaching height 5 from both sides:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to3} f(x)=5.\n$$\n\n### Example 3 — Irrelevant function value at point\nEven if $ f(1) = 1000 $, as long as values near 1 approach 2, the limit is still 2.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis\n\n- Limit behavior is strictly **local**; global properties of $ f $ do not matter.  \n- The value at the limit point is functionally irrelevant to the limit.  \n- Numerical tables must use values close enough to reveal a trend; coarse sampling can mislead.  \n- Graphs can hide subtle oscillation—limits require stability, not appearance.  \n\n**Key invariant:**  \nLimits describe approach behavior, not pointwise equality.\n\n---\n\n# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)\n\n### Tier A — foundational\n1. Use a small numerical table to estimate $ \\lim_{x\\to2} (x^2 - 3x + 5) $.  \n2. Based on a graph with a hole at $ x=4 $, estimate the limit from visual height.\n\n### Tier B — mixed\n3. Determine whether the limit exists as $ x\\to0 $ for $ f(x)=\\frac{|x|}{x} $.  \n4. Given values of $ f(x) $ near $ 3 $, argue whether they suggest a limit of 7.\n\n### Tier C — challenge\n5. Consider a function that oscillates between 1 and −1 with increasing frequency near $ x=0 $.  \n   Discuss whether numerical/graphical evidence can reliably detect if a limit exists.\n\n---\n\n# 7. Summary\n\n- Limits generalize “approach” behavior to arbitrary functions.  \n- Numerical and graphical tools provide non-rigorous but useful evidence.  \n- Standard notation expresses approach behavior symbolically.  \n- This lesson provides the base layer for algebraic rules, continuity, and epsilon–delta formalism.\n\n---\n\n# 8. Forward Links\n\nThis lesson supports:\n\n- Lesson 2: applying algebraic limit laws  \n- Lesson 3: directional behavior + asymptotics  \n- Lesson 4: foundations of continuity  \n- Lesson 5: transition to formal epsilon–delta definition\n\n## Math test\n\nInline: $x^2 + 1$.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1\n$$"

They encode direction of blow-up.  \n- One-sided limits are necessary when the function changes structure at a point (piecewise, absolute value, rational functions).  \n- Limits at infinity describe **global** behavior, but are computed using **local dominance patterns** (leading terms).  \n- Vertical asymptotes reflect denominator zeros where the numerator doesn’t vanish simultaneously.  \n- Horizontal asymptotes reflect stabilization of the ratio of dominant terms.\n\n**Invariants:**\n\n- A two-sided limit is determined entirely by its one-sided limits.  \n- Infinite limits are always “essential” discontinuities.  \n- Degree comparisons for rational functions are universally reliable for $ x\\to\\infty $.\n\n---\n\n# 6.

    "content": "# 1. Overview\n\nThis lesson formalizes **continuity** using limits and develops a precise\ntaxonomy of **discontinuities**. We analyze when a function behaves smoothly,\nwhen it fails, and how those failures differ structurally.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- Apply limit-based definitions of continuity.  \n- Distinguish continuity at a point vs. on an interval.  \n- Classify removable, jump, and essential discontinuities.  \n- Recognize when continuity can be “repaired.”  \n\n---\n\n# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson\n\none-sided → discontinuities-classification → removable-discontinuities  \nnotation → continuity-point → continuity-interval\n\n- Continuity relies on limit existence and agreement with value.  \n- Discontinuity classification depends on one-sided limits.  \n- Removable discontinuities arise when the limit exists but the function value is defective.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Core Exposition\n\n## 3.1 Continuity at a point\n\nA function $ f $ is **continuous at $ a $** if:\n\n1. $ f(a) $ is defined,  \n2. $ \\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) $ exists,  \n3. and they agree:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = f(a).\n$$\n\nContinuity is a local condition tied directly to limit behavior.\n\n---\n\n## 3.2 Continuity on an interval\n\nA function is **continuous on an interval** if it is continuous at:\n\n- every interior point,  \n- the right endpoint (for closed interval left side),  \n- the left endpoint (for closed interval right side).\n\nPolynomials, rational functions (nonzero denominators), exponential and\ntrigonometric functions are all continuous on their domains.\n\n---\n\n## 3.3 Classification of discontinuities\n\nThree fundamental types:\n\n### • Removable  \nFinite limit exists, but value is missing or mismatched.\n\n### • Jump  \nLeft and right limits exist but are unequal.\n\n### • Essential  \nIncludes:\n- infinite discontinuities (blow-up),  \n- oscillatory discontinuities,  \n- anything where no finite limit exists.\n\n---\n\n## 3.4 Removable discontinuities: structure\n\nA removable discontinuity arises when:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L, \\quad f(a) \\ne L \\text{ or } f(a) \\text{ undefined.}\n$$\nFix by defining:\n$$\nf(a) := L\n$$\n\n---\n\n# 4. Worked Examples\n\n### Example 1 — Confirming continuity\n$$\nf(x)=3x^2-1\n$$\nPolynomials are continuous everywhere.  \nDirect substitution gives the limit at any point.\n\n### Example 2 — Removable discontinuity\n$$\nf(x)=\\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}\n$$\nFactor:\n$$\nf(x)=x+3,\\quad x\\ne3\n$$\nLimit at 3 is 6, but function is undefined at 3 → removable.\n\n### Example 3 — Jump discontinuity\n$$\nf(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n1,& x<0,\\\\\n5,& x\\ge 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nLeft limit = 1, right limit = 5 → jump.\n\n### Example 4 — Essential (infinite)\n$$\nf(x)=\\frac{1}{x-2}\n$$\n(Left side → $ -\\infty $, right side → $ +\\infty $.)  \nNo finite limit → essential discontinuity.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis\n\n- Continuity represents “agreement” between the function’s definition and its\n  limiting behavior.  \n- Discontinuities reflect structural failures of this agreement.  \n- Jump discontinuities cannot be repaired by modifying the function at a single\n  point — the mismatch is directional.  \n- Infinite discontinuities describe unbounded behavior, not missing values.  \n- Continuous functions on closed intervals satisfy properties such as IVT and\n  always attain maxima/minima (later).\n\n**Invariants:**\n\n- Continuity at a point ⇔ limit exists and equals the function value.  \n- Removable ⇔ finite limit exists but point value is wrong.  \n- Jump ⇔ one-sided limits exist but differ.  \n- Essential ⇔ cannot confine function within any small band near the point.\n\n---\n\n# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)\n\n### Tier A — foundational\n\n1. Determine whether  \n$$\nf(x)=\\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}\n$$\n   is continuous at $ x=2 $.\n\n2. Determine:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to1} \\frac{|x-1|}{x-1}\n$$\n\n### Tier B — mixed\n\n3. Classify the discontinuity of  \n$$\nf(x)=\\begin{cases}\nx+1,&x\\neq2,\\\\\n0,&x=2.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n4. Determine all discontinuities of  \n$$\nf(x)=\\frac{x}{x^2-1}\n$$\n\n### Tier C — challenge\n\n5. A function oscillates increasingly near $ x=0 $, staying between −5 and 5.\n   Does it have a removable, jump, or essential discontinuity?\n\n6. A piecewise function satisfies\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to4^-}f(x)=2,\\quad \\lim_{x\\to4^+}f(x)=2,\\quad f(4)=100.\n$$\n   Identify the discontinuity and suggest a repair.\n\n---\n\n# 7. Summary\n\n- Continuity formalizes the idea of unbroken function behavior.  \n- Discontinuities appear when limit behavior and point values diverge.  \n- Three distinct failures: removable, jump, essential.  \n- Continuity and discontinuity classification are structural tools used heavily\n  in derivative definitions, IVT applications, and deeper analysis.\n\n---\n\n# 8.

    "content": "# 1. Overview\n\nThis final lesson unifies rigorous limit techniques with two fundamental\nexistence theorems. It extends the formal ε–δ definition into actual proofs and\nshows how bounding arguments and continuity yield structural conclusions.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- Construct epsilon–delta proofs for simple limits.  \n- Apply the Squeeze Theorem to evaluate constrained limits.  \n- Use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to guarantee the existence of\n  solutions.  \n- Understand how these tools form the rigorous foundation for later calculus\n  concepts such as derivatives and root-finding.\n\n---\n\n# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson\n\nepsilon-delta-definition → epsilon-delta-proofs  \nlimit-laws → squeeze-theorem  \ncontinuity-interval → ivt\n\n- Epsilon–delta proofs apply the formal definition.  \n- Squeeze uses bounding functions with matching limits.  \n- IVT requires continuity on closed intervals.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Core Exposition\n\n## 3.1 Epsilon–delta proof structure\n\nTo prove\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L,\n$$\nwe must produce a δ for an arbitrary ε:\n\n1. Start with $ |f(x)-L| < \\varepsilon $.  \n2. Express the left side in terms of $ |x-a| $.  \n3. Bound auxiliary expressions (e.g., $ |x+1| $).  \n4. Solve for δ in terms of ε.  \n5. Verify:\n$$\n0<|x-a|<\\delta \\Rightarrow |f(x)-L|<\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nThis “backwards planning” is universal.\n\n---\n\n## 3.2 Squeeze Theorem\n\nIf\n$$\ng(x) \\le f(x) \\le h(x)\n$$\nnear $ a $, and\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to a} h(x) = L,\n$$\nthen\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L\n$$\nUsed when direct computation is impossible but bounding behavior is known.\n\n---\n\n## 3.3 Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)\n\nIf $ f $ is continuous on $ [a,b] $ and $ N $ lies between $ f(a) $ and $ f(b) $, then there exists $ c \\in (a,b) $ with\n$$\nf(c)=N\n$$\n\nThis is an **existence theorem**, not a computational tool.\n\nApplications:\n- roots of equations  \n- sign changes  \n- argument principles about crossings\n\n---\n\n# 4. Worked Examples\n\n### Example 1 — ε–δ proof (linear function)\n\nProve:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 1} (5x-3)=2\n$$\nCompute:\n$$\n|(5x-3) - 2| = 5|x-1|\n$$\nChoose $ \\delta = \\varepsilon/5 $. Verification is immediate.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2 — ε–δ proof (quadratic with bounding)\n\nGoal:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to2} x^2 = 4\n$$\nRewrite:\n$$\n|x^2-4| = |x-2||x+2|\n$$\nIf $ |x-2|<1 $, then $ x \\in (1,3) $ so $ |x+2|<5 $. Thus:\n$$\n|x^2-4| < 5|x-2|\n$$\nPick:\n$$\n\\delta = \\min\\{1, \\varepsilon/5\\}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Example 3 — Squeeze Theorem\n\nEvaluate:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to0} x \\sin(1/x)\n$$\nBound:\n$$\n-|x| \\le x\\sin(1/x) \\le |x|\n$$\nBoth bounds → 0. Therefore the limit is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Example 4 — IVT: root existence\n\nShow that\n$$\nx^3 - x - 1 = 0\n$$\nhas a solution in (1,2).\n\nCompute:\n$$\nf(1)=-1,\\quad f(2)=5\n$$\n0 lies between −1 and 5 → IVT guarantees a root.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis\n\n- Epsilon–delta proofs embody full rigor. Every proof reduces to manipulating\n  inequalities and bounding factors.  \n- Squeeze captures asymptotic confinement: if upper and lower bounds stabilize,\n  the middle function must stabilize.  \n- IVT is topological: continuity prevents skipping values and enforces existence\n  of crossing points.\n\n**Invariants**\n\n- Limits proven via ε–δ are exact and do not rely on graphs or numeric\n  evidence.  \n- Squeeze is the default method for oscillatory or product-form limits.  \n- IVT guarantees existence only — never location — of solutions.  \n- All three tools integrate into the derivative definition in the next course.\n\n---\n\n# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)\n\n### Tier A — foundational\n\n1. Complete the ε–δ proof for\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to3} (2x+1)=7\n$$\n2. Use Squeeze to show\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to0} |x|\\cos(1/x)=0\n$$\n\n### Tier B — mixed\n\n3. Prove\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to1} x^3 = 1\n$$\nby bounding $ |x^2 + x + 1| $.\n\n4. Use IVT to explain why the equation\n$$\ne^x = 4\n$$\nhas a solution.\n\n### Tier C — challenge\n\n5. For\n$$\nf(x)=x^2\\sin(1/x),\n$$\nshow the limit at 0 is 0 by bounding $ |\\sin(1/x)| \\le 1 $ and using\npolynomial dominance.\n\n6. Let\n$$\nf(x)=x^5-7x+1\n$$\nShow that it has at least one root and at most three real roots (use IVT +\nmonotonicity reasoning).\n\n---\n\n# 7. Summary\n\n- Epsilon–delta proofs formalize limits through controlled tolerances.  \n- Squeeze Theorem resolves bounded functions when direct computation fails.  \n- IVT guarantees existence of intermediate values for continuous functions.  \n- Together they complete the rigorous foundation for calculus, connecting limits\n  to continuity and the derivative.\n\n---\n\n# 8. Forward Links\n\nThis lesson completes the *limits* course and leads directly into:\n\n- **`math-calculus-derivatives`** (next course)  \n- rigorous derivative definition via the limit  \n- continuity and differentiability relationships"
