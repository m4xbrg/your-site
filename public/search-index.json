Content types and their roles\n\n### 1.1 Subjects\n\n**File location:** `src/content/subjects/`  \n**Purpose:** High-level domains (e.g. `mathematics`, `physics`).  \n**Frontmatter (typical):**\n\n- `id: string` (usually matches the slug)\n- `title: string`\n- Optional labels, summary, tags\n\nSubjects rarely change. Most authors never touch these.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Macro-courses\n\n**File location:** `src/content/macro-courses/`  \n**Purpose:** Big arcs inside a subject (e.g. `math-calculus`).  \n**Frontmatter (typical):**\n\n- `id: string` (e.g. `math-calculus`)\n- `subject: \"mathematics\"`\n- `title: string`\n- Optional `description`, `order`, `tags`\n\nCourses attach to these via `macroId`.\n\n---\n\n### 1.3 Courses\n\n**File location:** `src/content/courses/`  \n**Purpose:** Concrete course units (e.g. `math-calculus-limits`).  \n\n**Frontmatter (canonical):**\n\n- `id: string` — **required**, used as the anchor ID  \n  - Example: `math-calculus-limits`\n- `subject: string` — **required**  \n  - Example: `mathematics`\n- `macroId?: string` — preferred  \n  - Example: `math-calculus`\n- `title: string`\n- `description?: string`\n- `order?: number` — ordering within the macro-course\n- `tags?: string[]`\n\nAll **lessons**, **concepts**, and **exercises** in a vertical should agree on `courseId`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. IDs and naming conventions\n\nUse **stable, descriptive IDs** that are:\n\n- Lowercase\n- Hyphen-separated\n- Namespaced by subject / course\n\nPatterns:\n\n- **Course IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits`, `math-analysis-sequences-limits`\n- **Concept IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits-informal-idea`  \n  `math-calculus-limits-continuity-interval`\n- **Lesson IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-01`  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-05-epsilon-delta`\n- **Exercise set IDs:**  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-01-exercises`  \n  `math-calculus-limits-lesson-05-epsilon-delta-exercises`\n\nOnce an `id` ships, **do not rename** it. Instead:\n\n- Keep the `id` stable.\n- Change only `title`, `summary`, or content.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Math syntax and LaTeX rules\n\nThe math pipeline is MDX → remark → KaTeX. Authoring rules:\n\n### 3.1 Allowed math syntaxes\n\n- **Inline math** — use single `$`:\n\n  ```md\n  The function $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous."

They then adopt the ε–δ definition (Lesson 05) and apply it in proofs alongside the Squeeze and Intermediate Value Theorems (Lesson 06). A concluding review consolidates the arc with targeted practice, mixed-format checks, and connections to derivative definitions."

Standard steps include direct substitution when the function is continuous at the point, algebraic manipulation to remove removable discontinuities, application of limit laws, and comparison to known benchmark limits.\n\n## Intuition\nThe goal is to reveal stable nearby behavior. If substitution works, the function was continuous there. If substitution yields $0/0$ or another indeterminate form, algebraic rewrites can expose cancellation or dominant terms. When algebra stalls, comparison or squeezing pinpoints the limiting value.\n\n## Variants\n- **Direct substitution:** Works for polynomials, rational functions with nonzero denominators, and continuous combinations.\n- **Algebraic cleanup:** Factorization, rationalization, and common denominators remove holes or expose cancellations.\n- **Standard limits:** Use benchmarks like $\\lim_{x\\to0} \\dfrac{\\sin x}{x}=1$ or $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1+1/x)^x = e$ as building blocks.\n- **Squeeze or comparison:** Trap an unknown limit between simpler expressions to force convergence.\n\n## Connections\n- Relies on limit laws to justify algebraic steps.\n- Partners with the Squeeze Theorem for oscillatory or bounded expressions.\n- Highlights removable discontinuities: successful cancellation shows a hidden continuous extension.\n\n## Errors\n- Applying substitution when the denominator tends to $0$ without checking for cancellation.\n- Using algebraic manipulations that change the domain near the limit point (e.g., multiplying by non-equivalent expressions).\n- Ignoring dominant terms for limits at infinity, leading to incorrect growth estimates.\n\n## Micro-checks\n1. **Question:** What is the first check when evaluating $\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)$?  \n   **Answer:** Try direct substitution; if it gives a finite value, the limit equals $f(a)$.\n2. **Question:** Which technique resolves a $0/0$ form in $\\lim_{x\\to 1} \\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$?  \n   **Answer:** Factorization and cancellation yield $\\lim_{x\\to1} (x+1)=2$.\n3. **Question:** When is the Squeeze Theorem preferred over algebraic manipulation?  \n   **Answer:** When the expression is bounded between two functions with known limits but resists direct simplification, such as $x\\sin(1/x)$ near $0$."

The heart of the proof is bounding $|f(x)-L|$ by expressions involving $|x-a|$.\n\n## Intuition\nWork backward: express $|f(x)-L|$ in terms of $|x-a|$ and constants, then choose $\\delta$ small enough to make the bound fall below $\\varepsilon$. Splitting the bound into manageable pieces (triangular inequality, factoring) reveals how $\\delta$ should depend on $\\varepsilon$.\n\n## Variants\n- **Linear and polynomial functions:** Bounds come directly from factoring and known coefficients.\n- **Quotients:** Ensure the denominator stays away from zero by simultaneously enforcing $|x-a|<1$ or similar constraints.\n- **Composition with continuous functions:** Combine known $\\delta$ choices via limit laws to avoid starting from scratch.\n\n## Connections\n- Complements computational shortcuts: even when limit laws predict the answer, an $\\varepsilon$–$\\delta$ proof justifies it rigorously.\n- Relies on inequality tools such as triangle inequality and bounding denominators away from zero.\n- Often paired with the Squeeze Theorem when direct bounding is difficult.\n\n## Errors\n- Choosing $\\delta$ that depends on $x$ after the start of the proof instead of a fixed value.\n- Forgetting to state auxiliary bounds (like $|x-a|<1$) that control denominators or higher powers.\n- Presenting $\\delta$ implicitly rather than giving an explicit formula or minimum of candidate bounds.\n\n## Micro-checks\n1. **Question:** What is the usual first step after fixing $\\varepsilon>0$?  \n   **Answer:** Manipulate $|f(x)-L|$ algebraically to express it in terms of $|x-a|$ and constants, guiding the choice of $\\delta$.\n2. **Question:** Why might a proof set $\\delta = \\min\\{1, \\varepsilon/5\\}$?  \n   **Answer:** The bound $1$ controls the size of $|x-a|$ for auxiliary estimates, while $\\varepsilon/5$ ensures the final inequality $|f(x)-L|<\\varepsilon$.\n3. **Question:** How can limit laws simplify an $\\varepsilon$–$\\delta$ proof?  \n   **Answer:** By allowing you to reuse proven limits for simpler components, reducing the proof to bounding each part separately."

A consistent trend toward a single value across both sides signals the limit.\n\n## Intuition\nZooming in on a graph near $a$ or sampling $f(x)$ values near $a$ should make the outputs cluster near the limit. If the two sides head to different numbers, the graph shows a jump; if values blow up, the graph shoots vertically; if values oscillate without narrowing, no limit appears.\n\n## Variants\n- **Table-based estimation:** Choose inputs approaching $a$ from above and below; compare the outputs.\n- **Graphical zoom:** Successive zoom levels reveal whether the plotted curve straightens toward a specific height.\n- **One-sided views:** When the domain is restricted, examine only the accessible side of $a$.\n\n## Connections\n- Supports the informal notion of limits by providing concrete evidence before formal proofs.\n- Reveals candidate values for $L$ that can be justified using $\\varepsilon$–$\\delta$ or algebraic limit laws.\n- Highlights discontinuities: agreement of both sides suggests continuity, disagreement suggests jumps or removable issues.\n\n## Errors\n- Reading the value at $x=a$ instead of nearby behavior, especially when a hole is present.\n- Trusting a single zoom level; coarse plots can hide oscillation or vertical growth.\n- Using symmetric step sizes only; asymmetric sampling may miss one-sided behavior on restricted domains.\n\n## Micro-checks\n1. **Question:** What graphical sign indicates $\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)$ exists and equals $L$?  \n   **Answer:** Both sides of the graph approach the horizontal height $L$ as they near $x=a$, even if a hole appears at $a$.\n2. **Question:** How can a table signal a jump discontinuity at $a$?  \n   **Answer:** The left-hand values approach one number while right-hand values approach a different number.\n3. **Question:** What table pattern suggests an infinite limit?  \n   **Answer:** Values grow without bound in magnitude as the inputs close in on $a$."

Explain why your answer is reasonable.\n\n   | $x$   | $f(x)$ |\n   |-------|--------|\n   | 1.8   | 3.7    |\n   | 1.9   | 3.9    |\n   | 1.99  | 3.99   |\n   | 2.01  | 4.01   |\n   | 2.1   | 4.3    |\n\n   **Solution.** The $f(x)$ values hover near $4$ as $x$ approaches $2$ from both sides, so $\\lim_{x\\to 2} f(x) = 4$. Because the nearby outputs stabilize around $4$ without jumping, the table supports the guess.\n\n2. **Reading limit notation** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Give a plain-language interpretation of $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to -1} f(x)=4$.\n\n   **Solution.** As $x$ gets closer to $-1$ (from either side) but is not exactly $-1$, the outputs $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to $4$; the limit describes the trend near $-1$, not necessarily the value at $x=-1$.\n\n## Intermediate drills\n\n3. **Comparing limit and function value** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Suppose $\\lim_{x\\to 5} f(x)=2$ and $f(5)=100$. Which number is the limit and why can it differ from $f(5)$?\n\n   **Solution.** The limit is $2$ because nearby values approach $2$ regardless of the jump at $x=5$. Limits depend on behavior around the point, so $f(5)$ can be anything without changing $\\lim_{x\\to 5} f(x)$.\n\n4. **One-sided table read** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ A table shows the right-hand behavior of $g$ near $x=0$:\n\n   | $x$   | $g(x)$ |\n   |-------|--------|\n   | 0.5   | 2.1    |\n   | 0.2   | 2.02   |\n   | 0.1   | 2.005  |\n   | 0.01  | 2.0005 |\n\n   Estimate $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} g(x)$ and explain why this is different from $g(0)$.\n\n   **Solution.** The outputs approach $2$, so $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} g(x)=2$. The limit ignores the actual value at $0$; $g(0)$ could be undefined or different while the trend from the right still targets $2$.\n\n## Conceptual insights\n\n5. **Graph interpretation** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ A graph shows an open circle at $(3,6)$ and a filled point at $(3,2)$. What are $\\lim_{x\\to 3} f(x)$ and $f(3)$? Is $f$ continuous at $3$?\n\n   **Solution.** The limit is $6$ because the curve approaches height $6$ from both sides. The function value is $f(3)=2$ (the filled point). Since the limit exists but differs from $f(3)$, $f$ is not continuous at $3$; the gap is removable.\n\n6. **Neighborhood language** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Describe what it means to say “for all $x$ in a small neighborhood of $a$, but $x\\neq a$, the values $f(x)$ are close to $L$.”\n\n   **Solution.** It means that if we pick $x$ values sufficiently near $a$ (excluding $a$ itself), the outputs cluster near $L$. This captures the intuitive idea of a limit without requiring that $f(a)$ equals $L$ or is even defined.\n\n## Curveball challenge\n\n7. **Ambiguous numeric evidence** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ You observe\n\n   | $x$     | $f(x)$ |\n   |---------|--------|\n   | 0.1     | 0.84   |\n   | 0.01    | 0.91   |\n   | 0.001   | 0.88   |\n   | 0.0001  | 0.93   |\n\n   Discuss the difficulty in deciding whether $\\lim_{x\\to 0} f(x)$ exists and what additional information would help.\n\n   **Solution.** The outputs wobble rather than settling, so the table alone cannot confirm convergence. More precision (smaller $|x|$), one-sided checks, or a graph/algebraic form could reveal whether values stabilize to a single number or oscillate.\n\n8. **Design a function with a hole** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Construct an explicit $f$ such that $\\lim_{x\\to 1} f(x)=3$ while $f(1)$ is undefined and the graph has a single hole at $x=1$.\n\n   **Solution.** Let $f(x)=\\dfrac{3(x-1)}{x-1}=3$ for $x\\neq 1$ and leave $f(1)$ undefined. For all $x\\neq1$, $f(x)=3$, so the limit is $3$; the missing point at $x=1$ creates the hole."

Polynomials are continuous everywhere, so direct substitution matches the limit.\n\n4. **Factor to remove a hole** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Evaluate $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 3} \\dfrac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}$.\n\n   **Solution.** Factor numerator: $x^2-9=(x-3)(x+2)$. Cancel $x-3$ (for $x\\neq3$) to get $\\lim_{x\\to3}(x+2)=5$. The original function has a removable discontinuity at $x=3$.\n\n5. **Rationalizing radicals** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Compute $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 4} \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x} - 2}{x - 4}$.\n\n   **Solution.** Multiply by the conjugate: $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x} - 2}{x - 4}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}+2}{\\sqrt{x}+2}=\\dfrac{x-4}{(x-4)(\\sqrt{x}+2)}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{x}+2}$. Now substitute $x=4$ to get $\\dfrac{1}{2+2}=\\dfrac14$.\n\n## Conceptual insights\n\n6. **Domain and continuity** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ For $f(x)=\\dfrac{2x^2 + 3x - 2}{x^2 - 1}$, list points where $f$ is undefined, classify the discontinuities, and state the limit at those points if it exists.\n\n   **Solution.** Denominator zero at $x=\\pm1$. Factor: $f(x)=\\dfrac{(2x-1)(x+2)}{(x-1)(x+1)}$. At $x=1$, common factor? none, so vertical asymptote, limits are infinite (do not exist finitely). At $x=-1$, factor cancels? yes $(x+1)$ cancels leaving $\\dfrac{(2x-1)(x+2)}{x-1}$ for $x\\neq -1$, so $\\lim_{x\\to -1} f(x)=\\dfrac{(2(-1)-1)((-1)+2)}{-1-1}=\\dfrac{-3\\cdot1}{-2}=\\dfrac32$, removable discontinuity.\n\n7. **Limit laws justification** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Explain why the limit of a product equals the product of limits when both exist, and give a quick example using $\\lim_{x\\to2}(x^2-4)(x-1)$.\n\n   **Solution.** Limit laws arise from epsilon–delta definitions: if each factor stays close to its limit, their product stays close to the product. Example: $\\lim_{x\\to2}(x^2-4)=0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to2}(x-1)=1$, so the product limit is $0\\cdot1=0$; substitution confirms it.\n\n## Curveball challenge\n\n8. **Composite simplification** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Evaluate $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 1} \\dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 - x}$ and explain each algebraic step.\n\n   **Solution.** Factor: numerator $(x-1)(x+1)$, denominator $x(x-1)$. Cancel $(x-1)$ (for $x\\neq1$) to get $\\lim_{x\\to1}\\dfrac{x+1}{x}$. Substitute $x=1$ to obtain $\\dfrac{2}{1}=2$. The cancellation removes a hole at $x=1$, so the simplified expression captures the limit.\n\n9. **Piecewise trap** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Define $g(x)=\\begin{cases}\\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}, & x\\neq2, \\\\ 10, & x=2.\\end{cases}$ Find $\\lim_{x\\to2} g(x)$ and state whether $g$ is continuous at $2$.\n\n   **Solution.** For $x\\neq2$, $g(x)=x+2$. Thus $\\lim_{x\\to2} g(x)=4$. But $g(2)=10$, so the function jumps at $2$ and is not continuous; the hole-filled value should be $4$ to restore continuity."

    "content": "## Basic practice\n\n1. **Right-hand approach** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Evaluate $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\dfrac{1}{x}$.\n\n   **Solution.** As $x$ approaches $0$ from the right, $1/x$ grows without bound, so the one-sided limit is $+\\infty$.\n\n2. **Left-hand approach** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Determine $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 0^-} \\dfrac{1}{x}$ and state the sign of the divergence.\n\n   **Solution.** Approaching $0$ from the left makes $x$ negative and tiny, so $1/x$ heads to $-\\infty$.\n\n## Intermediate drills\n\n3. **Vertical asymptote classification** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ For $f(x)=\\dfrac{2}{(x-1)^2}$, compute $\\lim_{x\\to1^-} f(x)$ and $\\lim_{x\\to1^+} f(x)$. What kind of discontinuity occurs at $x=1$?\n\n   **Solution.** The squared denominator stays positive while shrinking to $0$, so both one-sided limits are $+\\infty$. The function has an infinite (essential) discontinuity with a vertical asymptote at $x=1$.\n\n4. **End behavior** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Find $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to \\infty} \\dfrac{3x^2-5x+1}{x^2+2}$.\n\n   **Solution.** Divide numerator and denominator by $x^2$: $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{3-5/x+1/x^2}{1+2/x^2}=3$. The horizontal asymptote is $y=3$.\n\n## Conceptual insights\n\n5. **Detecting limit failure** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Explain why $\\lim_{x\\to0} \\dfrac{1}{x}$ does not exist, even though both one-sided limits exist.\n\n   **Solution.** The left-hand limit is $-\\infty$ and the right-hand limit is $+\\infty$; because they disagree (and are unbounded), the two-sided limit fails to exist.\n\n6. **Oscillatory behavior at infinity** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Consider $g(x)=\\sin x$. Does $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x)$ exist? Why or why not?\n\n   **Solution.** No. $\\sin x$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ without settling toward a single value, so the limit at infinity does not exist.\n\n## Curveball challenge\n\n7. **Piecewise one-sided check** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Let $h(x)=\\begin{cases}\\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}, & x<2, \\\\ x+5, & x\\ge 2.\\end{cases}$ Compute $\\lim_{x\\to2^-} h(x)$, $\\lim_{x\\to2^+} h(x)$, and decide whether $\\lim_{x\\to2} h(x)$ exists.\n\n   **Solution.** For $x<2$, simplify $(x^2-4)/(x-2)=x+2$ so $\\lim_{x\\to2^-} h(x)=4$. For $x\\ge2$, use $h(x)=x+5$, giving $\\lim_{x\\to2^+} h(x)=7$. The one-sided limits differ, so the two-sided limit does not exist (jump discontinuity).\n\n8. **Asymptote from degree difference** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Evaluate $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\dfrac{5x^3+1}{2x^2-7}$ and describe the end-behavior asymptote.\n\n   **Solution.** Highest power dominates; divide by $x^2$ to get $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}\\dfrac{5x+1/x^2}{2-7/x^2}$. As $x\\to-\\infty$, the expression behaves like $\\dfrac{5x}{2}$, so the function grows without bound to $-\\infty$ with an oblique asymptote $y=\\tfrac52 x$."

Substituting $x=0$ gives $f(0)=1$, matching the limit, so $f$ is continuous at $0$.\n\n2. **Interval continuity** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ On what intervals is $g(x)=\\dfrac{1}{x-3}$ continuous?\n\n   **Solution.** The function is continuous wherever its denominator is nonzero: $(-\\infty,3)$ and $(3,\\infty)$.\n\n## Intermediate drills\n\n3. **Removable hole** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ For $h(x)=\\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$, classify the discontinuity at $x=1$ and state $\\lim_{x\\to1} h(x)$.\n\n   **Solution.** Factor to $\\dfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}=x+1$ for $x\\neq1$. The limit is $2$ and the discontinuity is removable (a hole) at $x=1$.\n\n4. **Jump discontinuity** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Let $p(x)=\\begin{cases}x+2,& x<0,\\\\ x^2,& x\\ge0.\\end{cases}$ Does $\\lim_{x\\to0} p(x)$ exist? Is $p$ continuous at $0$?\n\n   **Solution.** $\\lim_{x\\to0^-}p(x)=2$ and $\\lim_{x\\to0^+}p(x)=0$. Since the one-sided limits differ, the two-sided limit fails and $p$ is not continuous at $0$ (jump discontinuity).\n\n## Conceptual insights\n\n5. **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Explain how IVT guarantees a root for a continuous function $f$ on $[a,b]$ when $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs.\n\n   **Solution.** Continuity ensures $f$ takes all intermediate values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. If the signs differ, $0$ lies between them, so there is some $c\\in(a,b)$ with $f(c)=0$.\n\n6. **Patching continuity** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ How can defining $f(1)$ appropriately make $f(x)=\\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ continuous at $x=1$?\n\n   **Solution.** The limit at $1$ is $2$. Setting $f(1)=2$ fills the hole, aligning the value with the limit and restoring continuity at $x=1$.\n\n## Curveball challenge\n\n7. **Classifying mixed discontinuities** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ For $q(x)=\\dfrac{x^2-9}{x^2-4}$, list all discontinuities and classify each.\n\n   **Solution.** Factor: numerator $(x-3)(x+3)$, denominator $(x-2)(x+2)$. The function is undefined at $x=2$ and $x=-2$. No factors cancel, so both are non-removable infinite discontinuities (vertical asymptotes). Elsewhere the function is continuous.\n\n8. **Continuous extension on an interval** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Define $r(x)=\\begin{cases}\\dfrac{\\sin x}{x}, & x\\neq0,\\\\ c, & x=0.\\end{cases}$ Find $c$ so that $r$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n   **Solution.** $\\lim_{x\\to0}\\dfrac{\\sin x}{x}=1$, so choose $c=1$. With $r(0)=1$, the value matches the limit and the piecewise definition becomes continuous everywhere."

Choose $\\delta=\\varepsilon/3$ so that $|x-2|<\\delta$ implies $|3x+1-7|<\\varepsilon$.\n\n2. **Translate notation** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Rewrite the statement “$\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)=L$” using $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$ language.\n\n   **Solution.** For every $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\\delta>0$ such that if $0<|x-a|<\\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\\varepsilon$.\n\n## Intermediate drills\n\n3. **Quadratic example** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Prove $\\lim_{x\\to1}(x^2)=1$ by selecting $\\delta$ as a function of $\\varepsilon$.\n\n   **Solution.** $|x^2-1|=|x-1||x+1|$.

Choose $\\varepsilon=|L_1-L_2|/3>0$. By the definition, there are $\\delta_1,\\delta_2$ such that values within both $\\delta$-windows stay within $\\varepsilon$ of each limit, forcing overlap where $f(x)$ is within $\\varepsilon$ of both $L_1$ and $L_2$.

Ensure both bounds share the same simple limit so the middle inherits it.\n\n6. **Using continuity inside proofs** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ How does continuity simplify epsilon–delta proofs for composite functions?\n\n   **Solution.** If inner and outer functions are continuous, one can replace the inner expression with its limit directly and rely on continuity to justify the outer limit, avoiding custom $\\delta$ selections for each composition.\n\n## Curveball challenge\n\n7. **Two-stage squeeze** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Prove $\\lim_{x\\to0} x\\sin(1/x)=0$ using a squeeze argument.\n\n   **Solution.** Since $-1\\le \\sin(1/x)\\le1$, multiplying by $x$ gives $-|x| \\le x\\sin(1/x) \\le |x|$. Both bounds approach $0$ as $x\\to0$, so by Squeeze Theorem the limit is $0$.\n\n8. **IVT with parameters** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Let $g(x)=x^3-3x+k$ with $k\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Use IVT to find a condition on $k$ that guarantees at least one root in $(0,2)$.\n\n   **Solution.** Evaluate $g(0)=k$ and $g(2)=8-6+k=2+k$. For a sign change, require $k$ and $2+k$ to have opposite signs: this occurs when $k<0<2+k$, i.e., $-2<k<0$. Continuity of the cubic then ensures a root in $(0,2)$."

    "content": "## Definition\nThe limit $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L$ means that for every $\\varepsilon>0$ there is an $M$ such that $x > M$ implies $|f(x)-L| < \\varepsilon$. A similar definition applies to $x\\to -\\infty$. Finite limits at infinity indicate horizontal asymptotes at height $L$.\n\n## Intuition\nAs $x$ grows large in magnitude, only dominant terms of $f(x)$ matter. If those terms balance to a constant, the function flattens toward that value; if they dominate without bound, the limit is infinite or does not exist.\n\n## Variants\n- **Rational functions:** Compare degrees of numerator and denominator to predict the limit.\n- **Exponential growth/decay:** Exponentials dominate polynomials, leading to infinite limits or zero limits depending on sign.\n- **Oscillatory functions:** Functions like $\\sin x$ lack limits at infinity because outputs keep swinging.\n\n## Connections\n- Complements infinite limits, which look at unbounded function values near finite points.\n- Dominant-term reasoning parallels series and asymptotic analysis in later courses.\n- Horizontal asymptotes from limits at infinity aid graphing and understanding end behavior.\n\n## Errors\n- Assuming any function with a horizontal asymptote must cross it; limits describe approach, not intersection.\n- Ignoring sign when comparing dominant terms, leading to wrong $\\pm\\infty$ conclusions.\n- Claiming a limit exists at infinity without verifying stabilization across large magnitudes.\n\n## Micro-checks\n1. **Question:** What does $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L$ say about $f(x)$ for large $x$?  \n   **Answer:** That $f(x)$ stays within any desired tolerance of $L$ once $x$ exceeds some bound.\n2. **Question:** How do you find $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\dfrac{3x^2+1}{x^2-4}$?  \n   **Answer:** Compare leading terms; the ratio of coefficients gives the limit $3$.\n3. **Question:** Why does $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\sin x$ not exist?  \n   **Answer:** The values keep oscillating between $-1$ and $1$ without settling toward a single number."

Estimate $\\lim_{x\\to-1} f(x)$ and $f(-1)$.\n\n   **Solution.** The trend near $-1$ approaches height $3$, so $\\lim_{x\\to-1} f(x)=3$. The filled dot gives $f(-1)=5$. The mismatch signals a removable discontinuity.\n\n2. **Limit language** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Tags: notation)._ Give a precise verbal statement for $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} g(x)=2$.\n\n   **Solution.** For $x$ values sufficiently close to $0$ from the right (but not equal to $0$), $g(x)$ can be made as close to $2$ as desired.\n\n## Algebraic fluency & continuity\n\n3. **Factor to evaluate** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: limit laws, removable discontinuity)._ Compute $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to3} \\dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}$ and describe the discontinuity of $h(x)=\\dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}$.\n\n   **Solution.** Factor to $(x-3)(x+3)/(x-3)=x+3$ for $x\\neq3$. The limit is $6$. $h$ has a removable hole at $x=3$.\n\n4. **Continuity decision** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: continuity, IVT)._ Is $p(x)=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}-2}{x-4}$ continuous at $x=4$ after simplification? State the limit and the extended value that would make it continuous.\n\n   **Solution.** Multiply by the conjugate to simplify to $1/(\\sqrt{x}+2)$. The limit at $x=4$ is $1/4$. Defining $p(4)=1/4$ fills the hole and makes $p$ continuous there.\n\n## One-sided, infinite, and end behavior\n\n5. **One-sided asymptote** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: one-sided, infinite limits)._ Evaluate $\\lim_{x\\to1^-} \\dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}$ and $\\lim_{x\\to1^+} \\dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}$; classify the discontinuity.\n\n   **Solution.** Both sides approach $+\\infty$ because the squared denominator shrinks to $0^+$. There is a vertical asymptote (infinite discontinuity) at $x=1$.\n\n6. **Limit at infinity** _(Difficulty: Basic; Tags: end behavior)._ Find $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\dfrac{5x^2-3x+1}{x^2+4}$.\n\n   **Solution.** Divide by $x^2$: $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}\\dfrac{5-3/x+1/x^2}{1+4/x^2}=5$. Horizontal asymptote $y=5$.\n\n## Proof tools: epsilon–delta, squeeze, and theorems\n\n7. **Epsilon–delta linear** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Tags: epsilon-delta)._ Provide $\\delta$ in terms of $\\varepsilon$ to prove $\\lim_{x\\to2}(4x-1)=7$.\n\n   **Solution.** $|(4x-1)-7|=4|x-2|$. Choose $\\delta=\\varepsilon/4$ so $|x-2|<\\delta$ guarantees $|(4x-1)-7|<\\varepsilon$.\n\n8. **Squeeze capstone** _(Difficulty: Curveball; Tags: squeeze theorem, oscillation)._ Prove $\\lim_{x\\to0} x\\sin(1/x^2)=0$.\n\n   **Solution.** Since $-1\\le\\sin(1/x^2)\\le1$, multiplying by $x$ gives $-|x|\\le x\\sin(1/x^2)\\le|x|$. Both bounds $\\to0$ as $x\\to0$, so the Squeeze Theorem yields the limit $0$.\n\n9. **IVT with parameter** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: IVT, continuity)._ For $f(x)=x^3-4x+k$, determine values of $k$ ensuring a root in $(1,2)$.\n\n   **Solution.** Evaluate $f(1)= -3+k$ and $f(2)=8-8+k=k$. A sign change in $(1,2)$ requires $( -3+k)$ and $k$ to have opposite signs: $k<0$ and $-3+k>0$ or vice versa. The consistent interval is $0<k<3$, ensuring $f(1)<0<f(2)$ and a root by IVT.\n\n## Conceptual synthesis curveballs\n\n10. **Limit does not equal value** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Tags: continuity, notation)._ Explain with an example how a limit can exist while $f(a)$ is undefined.\n\n    **Solution.** $f(x)=\\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ is undefined at $x=1$, yet $\\lim_{x\\to1} f(x)=2$ after simplification. The limit reflects nearby behavior, independent of the missing point.\n\n11. **Oscillation vs. divergence** _(Difficulty: Curveball; Tags: one-sided, infinite limits)._ Contrast $\\lim_{x\\to0} \\dfrac{1}{x}$ with $\\lim_{x\\to0} \\sin(1/x)$ in terms of existence and type of non-convergence.\n\n    **Solution.** $1/x$ diverges to $\\pm\\infty$ with opposing one-sided limits, so the limit fails by unboundedness. $\\sin(1/x)$ stays bounded but oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ infinitely often near $0$, preventing convergence to a single value."

The statement holds for one-sided limits and for limits at infinity with the same bounding idea.\n\n## Intuition\nWhen $f$ is sandwiched tightly between two functions converging to the same target, $f$ has nowhere else to go—it must converge to that target too. This is especially useful for functions whose direct analysis is messy but whose magnitude can be bounded.\n\n## Variants\n- **Absolute value bounds:** Using $|f(x)| \\le g(x)$ with $g(x)\\to 0$ forces $f(x)\\to 0$.\n- **Limits at infinity:** Bounds that hold for large $|x|$ can show end behavior, such as $x\\sin(1/x)$ near $0$ or $\\dfrac{\\sin x}{x}$ as $x\\to\\infty$.\n- **Piecewise bounding:** Different bounds may be needed on different sides of $a$ before applying the theorem.\n\n## Connections\n- Complements limit laws by handling cases where algebra alone cannot resolve an indeterminate form.\n- Commonly paired with trigonometric inequalities (e.g., $-1 \\le \\sin t \\le 1$) to evaluate tricky limits.\n- Provides $\\varepsilon$–$\\delta$ proofs: once bounds are established, the shared limit yields the needed $\\delta$ choices.\n\n## Errors\n- Forgetting to verify the inequality near the point of interest, not just globally.\n- Bounding with functions that do not share a common limit, leaving the conclusion unjustified.\n- Applying the theorem when the bounding interval excludes necessary approach directions.\n\n## Micro-checks\n1. **Question:** What two ingredients are required to use the Squeeze Theorem?  \n   **Answer:** A pair of bounding functions with a common limit and an interval where the inequalities hold near the point.\n2. **Question:** How does the inequality $-1 \\le \\sin t \\le 1$ help evaluate $\\lim_{x\\to 0} x\\sin(1/x)$?  \n   **Answer:** Multiplying by $|x|$ shows $-|x| \\le x\\sin(1/x) \\le |x|$, and both bounds go to $0$, so the squeezed limit is $0$.\n3. **Question:** Can the Squeeze Theorem handle limits at infinity?  \n   **Answer:** Yes; if the bounding functions converge to the same value for large $|x|$, the middle function shares that end behavior."
