Integrals reverse differentiation and measure accumulation. Core concepts include:

- Viewing definite integrals as signed areas under a curve and approximating them with Riemann sums.
- Finding antiderivatives through substitution and basic integration rules.
- Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to connect integrals and derivatives.

With integrals you can compute displacement from velocity, total growth from a rate, and many other cumulative quantities.
