The derivative of a function at a point is the limit of its average rate of change over shrinking intervals. Practically, you will:

- Differentiate polynomials, exponentials, and trigonometric functions using power, product, and chain rules.
- Interpret derivatives as slopes of tangent lines and as velocities in motion problems.
- Analyze critical points and monotonicity to sketch function behavior.

Mastery of derivative rules unlocks optimization and mathematical modeling of change.
