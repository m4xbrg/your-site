# Limits

Intuitively, the limit of a function describes what value it approaches as the input approaches some point.

## Formal definition (ε–δ)
We say \(\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L\) if for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that whenever \(0 < |x-a| < \delta\), we have \(|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\).

## Examples
- \(\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1\)
- \(\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0\)
