learningGoals:
  - State the $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definition of $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$.
  - Interpret $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ as controlling output and input closeness.
  - Recognize how the definition formalizes the informal idea of approaching a limit.

## Definition
We say $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$ if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $0 < |x-a| < \delta$, the inequality $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ holds. The exclusion $x \ne a$ ensures the limit depends on nearby behavior, not the function value at $a$.

## Intuition
The definition promises control: no matter how small a target band $|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$ you demand, there is a correspondingly small window $|x-a|<\delta$ that keeps outputs inside that band. Choosing $\delta$ answers the challenge set by $\varepsilon$.

## Variants
- **One-sided versions:** Replace $|x-a|<\delta$ with $0 < x-a < \delta$ or $0 < a-x < \delta$ for directional limits.
- **Infinite limits:** Modify the conclusion to $f(x)$ exceeding a bound $M$ rather than approaching $L$.
- **Limits at infinity:** Replace $|x-a|<\delta$ with $x$ sufficiently large in magnitude.

## Connections
- Provides the rigorous backbone for limit laws and continuity proofs.
- Shows why changing $f(a)$ does not affect the limit: the definition never uses $f(a)$.
- Guides construction of $\delta$ choices in proofs, often by algebraic manipulation or bounding arguments.

## Errors
- Forgetting the $0<|x-a|$ condition, which is needed to ignore the value at $a$.
- Treating $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ as fixed rather than universally quantified; $\delta$ must respond to any positive $\varepsilon$.
- Choosing $\delta$ that depends on $x$ instead of depending only on $\varepsilon$ and known constants.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What does the existence of a suitable $\delta$ for every $\varepsilon$ guarantee?  
   **Answer:** That inputs sufficiently close to $a$ force outputs to lie within $\varepsilon$ of $L$, establishing the limit.
2. **Question:** Why is the condition $0 < |x-a|$ included?  
   **Answer:** To exclude the point $a$ so that the limit captures nearby behavior independent of $f(a)$.
3. **Question:** How does the definition change for $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \infty$?  
   **Answer:** For every $M>0$ there must be a $\delta>0$ so that $0<|x-a|<\delta$ implies $f(x) > M$ (or $< -M$ for $-\infty$).
