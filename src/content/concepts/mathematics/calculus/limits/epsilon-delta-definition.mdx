## Snapshot

The epsilon–delta definition replaces the informal idea of “getting close” with
a precise condition involving two small positive numbers: $\varepsilon$ (output
tolerance) and $\delta$ (input radius).

## Formal Definition

Let $f$ be a real-valued function, $a$ a real number, and $L$ a real number.

We say that
```tex
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
```
iff
```tex
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } 0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Rightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon.
```

Interpretation:

- “For every $\varepsilon > 0$”: no matter how strict the output tolerance.  
- “There exists $\delta > 0$”: for each $\varepsilon$, some radius around $a$ works.  
- The implication ties **input closeness** to **output closeness**.  
- $f(a)$ does not appear; limits are about nearby values, not necessarily at $a$.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Read the condition
```tex
0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Rightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon
```
as: whenever $x$ is sufficiently close (but not equal) to $a$, then $f(x)$ is
within $\varepsilon$ of $L$. The chosen $\delta$ may depend on $\varepsilon$
(and on $f$), but once fixed it must work for **all** $x$ with $0<|x-a|<\delta$.

## Examples (Conceptual)

1. **Constant function**  
For $f(x)=c$,
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = c
```
is immediate since $|f(x)-c|=0$.

2. **Linear function**  
For $f(x)=mx+b$,
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=ma+b,\quad |f(x)-(ma+b)|=|m||x-a|,
\quad \delta=\varepsilon/|m|\ (m\ne 0).
```

3. **Limit without function value**  
The limit can exist even if $f(a)$ is undefined or $\ne L$.

## Quantifier Structure
```tex
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0,\ \forall x,\ 
\big( 0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Rightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon \big).
```
Order matters: the universal $\varepsilon$ is **outside** the existential $\delta$.

## Relationship to Informal Limits

“$f(x)$ approaches $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$” is made precise by the
epsilon–delta condition: $\varepsilon$ measures output closeness; $\delta$
describes input closeness that guarantees it.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Wrong quantifier order** (`\exists\delta \forall\varepsilon`)—not equivalent.  
2. **$\delta$ depending on $x$** — Once chosen, it must work for all $x$ in $0<|x-a|<\delta$.  
3. **Including $x=a$** — The punctured condition is essential.  
4. **Misunderstanding $L$** — The statement asserts properties of a candidate $L$.

## Exercises

1. Translate the definition to plain language.  
2. For $f(x)=5$, verify directly that
```tex
\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5.
```
3. For $f(x)=3x-1$, outline an $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proof that
```tex
\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5.
```
4. Give an example where the definition fails for any $L$ and explain which part breaks.
