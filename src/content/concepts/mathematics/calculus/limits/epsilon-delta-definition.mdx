## Snapshot

The epsilon–delta definition replaces the informal idea of “getting close” with
a precise condition involving two small positive numbers:

- $\epsilon$ (epsilon) controls how close the outputs must be to the limit.
- $\delta$ (delta) controls how close the inputs must be to the point.

The definition is fully quantifier-based and is the foundation for rigorous
analysis.

## Formal Definition

Let $f$ be a real-valued function, $a$ a real number, and $L$ a real number.

We say that

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

if and only if the following condition holds:

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that }
0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Rightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon.
$$

Interpretation of the quantifiers:

- “For every $\varepsilon > 0$” means: no matter how strict your tolerance on
  the output, the condition must work.
- “There exists $\delta > 0$” means: for each chosen $\varepsilon$, there is
  some radius around $a$ that makes the implication true.
- The implication connects **input closeness** ($|x - a| < \delta$) with
  **output closeness** ($|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$).

## Intuition & Interpretation

The condition

$$
0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Rightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon
$$

should be read as:

> Whenever $x$ is sufficiently close to $a$ (but not equal to $a$), then the
> corresponding value $f(x)$ is close to $L$ within the required tolerance.

Important points:

- The value $f(a)$ does **not** appear in the core inequality. The limit only
  depends on values of $f(x)$ near $a$, not necessarily at $a$.
- The choice of $\delta$ may depend on $\varepsilon$ and on the function $f$,
  but it cannot depend on $x$. Once an $\varepsilon$ is fixed, a single
  $\delta$ must work for all $x$ in the punctured interval $0 < |x - a| < \delta$.

## Examples (Conceptual)

1. **Constant function**

   For $f(x) = c$, the statement

   $$
   \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = c
   $$

   is true. Given any $\varepsilon > 0$, one can choose any $\delta > 0$, since
   $|f(x) - c| = 0$ is always less than $\varepsilon$.

2. **Linear function**

   For $f(x) = mx + b$, we expect

   $$
   \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = ma + b.
   $$

   The epsilon–delta proof uses the fact that

   $$
   |f(x) - (ma + b)| = |m||x - a|.
   $$

   Then, given $\varepsilon > 0$, we can choose

   $$
   \delta = \frac{\varepsilon}{|m|}
   $$

   (assuming $m \neq 0$) to make the inequality hold.

3. **Limit without function value**

   It is possible for the limit to exist even if $f(a)$ is undefined or
   different from $L$. The epsilon–delta condition only involves values of
   $f(x)$ with $x \neq a$.

## Quantifier Structure

The logical pattern is

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0,\ \forall x,\ 
\big( 0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Rightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon \big).
$$

Things to note:

- The universal quantifier on $\varepsilon$ comes **first**: the definition must
  work for *every* tolerance.
- For each $\varepsilon$, there may be a different $\delta$. There is no
  requirement that a single $\delta$ works for all epsilons.
- The inner universal quantifier over $x$ expresses that once $\delta$ is fixed,
  the implication must hold for *all* $x$ in that punctured neighborhood.

Changing the order of quantifiers would change the meaning dramatically and
usually break the definition.

## Relationship to Informal Limits

The informal phrase

> “$f(x)$ approaches $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$”

is made precise by the epsilon–delta condition. Roughly:

- $\varepsilon$ measures how close “approaches” must be in the output.
- $\delta$ describes how close to $a$ we need to get in the input to enforce
  that output closeness.

The epsilon–delta definition ensures that this behavior is stable under small
perturbations of $x$ near $a$.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Wrong quantifier order**

   Writing

   $$
   \exists \delta > 0,\ \forall \varepsilon > 0, \dots
   $$

   reverses the intended logical structure and does **not** define a limit.

2. **Delta depending on $x$**

   $\delta$ may depend on $\varepsilon$, but once chosen, it must work for
   **all** $x$ satisfying $0 < |x - a| < \delta$. A “delta that depends on $x$”
   would not satisfy the definition.

3. **Including $x = a$ in the condition**

   The inequality uses $0 < |x - a|$ rather than $|x - a| \le \delta$ to make
   the definition independent of $f(a)$.

4. **Confusing the role of $L$**

   The number $L$ is part of the statement. The definition does not “find” $L$;
   it specifies what must be true for a *given* candidate $L$ to be the limit.

## Exercises

1. **Translating the definition**

   Rewrite the epsilon–delta definition in plain language, explaining the
   meaning of each quantifier and implication.

2. **Constant function**

   For $f(x) = 5$, verify directly from the epsilon–delta definition that

   $$
   \lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5.
   $$

   Describe how you would choose $\delta$ in terms of $\varepsilon$.

3. **Linear example**

   For $f(x) = 3x - 1$, sketch how you would prove using the definition that

   $$
   \lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5.
   $$

   (You do not need to give a full formal proof, but indicate the key steps.)

4. **Existence vs. non-existence**

   Give an example of a function and a point $a$ where the epsilon–delta
   condition fails for any candidate $L$. Explain which part of the definition
   breaks.
