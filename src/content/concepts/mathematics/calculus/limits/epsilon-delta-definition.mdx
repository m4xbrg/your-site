## Snapshot

The epsilon–delta definition gives a precise mathematical meaning to the idea
that \( f(x) \) gets arbitrarily close to \( L \) as \( x \) gets sufficiently
close to \( a \). It expresses the limit entirely via quantifiers, inequalities,
and neighborhoods.

## Formal Statement

We say:

\[
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
\]

**if and only if**:

\[
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0\ \text{such that}\ 
0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon.
\]

Key structural components:

- \( \varepsilon \) represents an arbitrary tolerance on the **output**.  
- \( \delta \) represents a corresponding restriction on the **input**.  
- The implication is conditional: we only consider points near \( a \) but not
  equal to \( a \).  
- The quantifier order (∀ then ∃) is essential.  
- The definition makes no reference to the value of \( f(a) \).

## Intuition & Interpretation

This definition formalizes “\( f(x) \) approaches \( L \) as \( x \) approaches
\( a \)” via:

- **Output closeness:** \( f(x) \) stays within any arbitrary band of radius
  \( \varepsilon \) around \( L \).  
- **Input control:** By restricting \( x \) to be sufficiently close to \( a \),
  the function becomes confined to that band.

The heart of the definition is **stability**: no matter how tight a tolerance we
choose around \( L \), we can always find a neighborhood around \( a \) that
forces \( f(x) \) to stay inside the band.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Constant function**
   \[
   f(x)=5.
   \]
   For any \( \varepsilon>0 \), choosing any \( \delta>0 \) works, since  
   \( |f(x)-5|=0<\varepsilon \).

2. **Linear function**
   To show:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 2} (3x+1) = 7,
   \]
   note:
   \[
   |(3x+1) - 7| = 3|x-2|.
   \]
   Setting \( \delta = \varepsilon/3 \) satisfies the definition.

3. **Quadratic function**  
   For  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 1} (x^2) = 1,
   \]
   rewrite:
   \[
   |x^2 - 1| = |x-1||x+1|.
   \]

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump discontinuity**  
   One-sided limits disagree → impossible to satisfy epsilon–delta conditions
   with a single \( L \).

2. **Infinite behavior**  
   If  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = +\infty,
   \]
   no finite \( L \) satisfies the epsilon–delta definition.

3. **Oscillation**
   For  
   \[
   f(x)=\sin(1/x)
   \]
   near 0, no neighborhood forces the function into an arbitrarily small band.

## Properties & Relationships

- The epsilon–delta definition is logically equivalent to all standard informal
  and graphical notions, but adds precision.
- It supports formal proofs of:
  - limit laws,  
  - continuity,  
  - derivative definition.
- The definition excludes the point \( x=a \) with \( 0<|x-a|<\delta \).
- One-sided limits have modified definitions:
  - \( x>a \) or \( x<a \) constraints replace the symmetric band.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Reversing quantifiers (∃ before ∀).  
2. Forgetting the condition \( 0 < |x-a| \).  
3. Believing epsilon–delta defines the limit value (it only *verifies* it).  
4. Treating \( \delta \) as independent of \( \varepsilon \).  
5. Assuming the value of the function at the limit point is relevant.

## Exercises

1. **Warm-up translation**  
   Rewrite the statement  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 3} (4x - 1) = 11
   \]
   fully in epsilon–delta form.

2. **Linear delta choice**  
   Show that for  
   \[
   f(x)=2x+5,
   \]
   choosing \( \delta = \varepsilon/2 \) satisfies the definition at any point.

3. **Bounded factor technique**  
   Show that  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to1} x^2 = 1
   \]
   by bounding \( |x+1| \) when \( |x-1|<1 \).

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Explain why the definition implies uniqueness: if two numbers satisfy the
   epsilon–delta condition, they must be equal.
