## Snapshot

When a function grows without bound as $ x $ approaches a finite point, the
limit is infinite. This captures vertical asymptotic behavior and is formally
expressed using one-sided limit notation. Infinite limits signal a specific type
of discontinuity that cannot be removed by redefining the function at the point.

## Formal Statement

We write

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = +\infty
```
$$

```tex
to mean that for all sufficiently close values of $ x \neq a $, the values
```
$ f(x) $ become arbitrarily large and positive. Similarly,

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = -\infty
```
$$

means $ f(x) $ becomes arbitrarily large in magnitude but negative.

Most infinite limits are intrinsically **one-sided**, written as:

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = +\infty,
```
```tex
\qquad
```
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = -\infty.
```
$$

These expressions describe divergent behavior near a finite input value.

A point $ x = a $ is a **vertical asymptote** of $ f(x) $ if at least one of:

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \pm\infty
```
```tex
\qquad\text{or}\qquad
```
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = \pm\infty
```
$$

holds.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Infinite limits describe how a function behaves near points where the output is
forced to grow without bound. They indicate:

- the function cannot be stabilized near the point,  
- the function’s magnitude dominates any local variation,  
- the vertical line $ x = a $ acts as a boundary the function cannot cross
  smoothly.

These limits characterize **essential** rather than removable discontinuities.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Simple rational blow-up**
$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to1} \frac{1}{x-1} = 
```
```tex
\begin{cases}
```
```tex
-\infty,& x\to1^-,\\[4pt]
```
```tex
+\infty,& x\to1^+.
```
```tex
\end{cases}
```
$$

2. **Squared denominator**
$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to0} \frac{1}{x^2} = +\infty.
```
$$

3. **Polynomial reciprocal**
$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to2^-} \frac{1}{(x-2)^3} = -\infty,
```
```tex
\qquad
```
```tex
\lim_{x\to2^+} \frac{1}{(x-2)^3} = +\infty.
```
$$

4. **Vertical asymptote from a logarithm**
$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to0^+} \ln(x) = -\infty.
```
$$

### Non-Examples

1. **Oscillation near the point**
$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to0} \sin(1/x)
```
$$
does not have an infinite limit; the function never stabilizes.

2. **Removable discontinuity**
$$
```tex
\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}
```
$$
has a hole at $ x=2 $, but the limit is finite (3), so not an infinite limit.

3. **Undefined value with no blow-up**  
A function can be undefined at a point but still have a finite limit.

## Properties & Relationships

- Infinite limits indicate **essential discontinuities** (not removable).  
- They always correspond to vertical asymptotes.  
- One-sided limits must be checked individually.  
- Algebraic sign analysis near the point often determines whether the limit is
  $ +\infty $ or $ -\infty $.  
- Infinite limits differ from “limit does not exist” due to oscillation; infinite
  limits express divergence in a controlled monotonic manner.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming both one-sided infinite limits must match.  
2. Confusing undefined values with infinite behavior.  
3. Mixing up sign conventions when analyzing denominators.  
4. Forgetting that infinite limits formally count as “does not exist”—but in a
   structured way that still conveys precise behavior.

## Exercises

1. **Compute**
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to3^+} \frac{1}{x-3}.
```
$$

2. **Left vs right**
   Determine the left-hand and right-hand limits for  
   $$
```tex
f(x)=\frac{2}{(x+1)^2}.
```
$$

3. **Sign analysis**
   Evaluate  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to -2^-} \frac{1}{(x+2)}.
```
$$

4. **Conceptual**
   Explain why every infinite limit corresponds to a vertical asymptote, but not
   every undefined point corresponds to one.

5. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Show that if $ f(x) > 0 $ near $ a $ and  
   $ \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = +\infty $, then  
   $ \frac{1}{f(x)} \to 0 $ as $ x \to a $.
