## Definition
We write $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \infty$ when for every bound $M>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $0<|x-a|<\delta$ implies $f(x)>M$. The notation $= -\infty$ is analogous with $f(x)<-M$. Infinite one-sided limits describe blow-up from a single direction.

## Intuition
Near $x=a$, the function climbs (or falls) without stabilizing at any finite height. Graphs show vertical spikes, often indicating a vertical asymptote at $x=a$.

## Variants
- **One-sided infinite limits:** Only the left or right side diverges, common with rational functions having odd powers in the denominator.
- **Symmetric blow-up:** Both sides head to the same infinity, producing a clear vertical asymptote.
- **Opposite-side behavior:** Left and right may diverge with opposite signs, forming different asymptotic branches.

## Connections
- Classifies essential discontinuities where function values become unbounded.
- Informs graphing: a vertical line $x=a$ is an asymptote when at least one infinite one-sided limit occurs.
- Distinguishes from limits at infinity, which examine behavior as $x$ grows large rather than approaching a finite point.

## Errors
- Treating a very large finite value as evidence of an infinite limit without checking unbounded growth.
- Ignoring directional differences; one side may diverge while the other remains finite.
- Forgetting that infinite limits do not count as finite limit existence, so continuity fails at that point.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What does $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=\infty$ assert?  
   **Answer:** That $f(x)$ exceeds any chosen bound for inputs sufficiently close to $a$, indicating unbounded growth.
2. **Question:** How can you show $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote using limits?  
   **Answer:** Demonstrate that at least one of $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ or $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ is $\pm\infty$.
3. **Question:** Does $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=\infty$ mean $f(a)$ exists?  
   **Answer:** No; the function may be undefined at $a$, and even if defined it cannot make the limit finite.
