## Snapshot

When $f(x)$ grows without bound as $x$ approaches a finite point, the limit is
**infinite**. This captures vertical asymptotic behavior and is expressed using
one‑sided notation.

## Formal Statement

We write
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = +\infty
```
to mean: for $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ (with $x\ne a$), the values $f(x)$
become arbitrarily large and positive. Similarly,
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = -\infty
```
means $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily large in magnitude but negative.

Infinite limits are often **one‑sided**:
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = +\infty,
\qquad
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = -\infty.
```

A point $x=a$ is a **vertical asymptote** if at least one of
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \pm\infty \quad \text{or} \quad \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = \pm\infty
```
holds.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Infinite limits indicate that the function cannot be stabilized near the point,
and the line $x=a$ acts as a vertical boundary.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1.
```tex
\lim_{x\to1} \frac{1}{x-1} =
\begin{cases}
-\infty,& x\to1^-,\\[4pt]
+\infty,& x\to1^+.
\end{cases}
```

2.
```tex
\lim_{x\to0} \frac{1}{x^2} = +\infty.
```

3.
```tex
\lim_{x\to2^-} \frac{1}{(x-2)^3} = -\infty,\qquad
\lim_{x\to2^+} \frac{1}{(x-2)^3} = +\infty.
```

4.
```tex
\lim_{x\to0^+} \ln x = -\infty.
```

### Non-Examples

1. **Oscillation**
```tex
\lim_{x\to0} \sin(1/x) \ \text{does not exist (not infinite).}
```

2. **Removable hole**
```tex
\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}
```
has a finite limit (3) at $x=2$.

3. **Undefined without blow‑up** — Undefined at a point may still have a finite limit.

## Properties & Relationships

- Infinite limits imply **essential** discontinuities.  
- One‑sided limits must be checked separately.  
- Sign analysis near the point determines $+\infty$ vs $-\infty$.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming both one‑sided infinite limits match.  
2. Confusing undefined with infinite behavior.  
3. Sign mistakes in denominator analysis.  
4. Forgetting infinite limits are a specific kind of “DNE” with structure.

## Exercises

1. Compute
```tex
\lim_{x\to3^+} \frac{1}{x-3}.
```

2. Left vs right — Determine one‑sided limits for
```tex
f(x)=\frac{2}{(x+1)^2}.
```

3. Sign analysis — Evaluate
```tex
\lim_{x\to -2^-} \frac{1}{x+2}.
```

4. Conceptual — Why does every infinite limit correspond to a vertical asymptote, but not vice versa?

5. Mini‑proof — If $f(x) > 0$ near $a$ and $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = +\infty$, show $\dfrac{1}{f(x)} \to 0$.
