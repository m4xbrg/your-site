## Snapshot

The Squeeze Theorem evaluates limits when $f$ is trapped between two simpler
functions with the **same** limit.

## Formal Statement

Let $g,f,h$ be defined near $a$ (except possibly at $a$). Suppose:

1) For $x$ sufficiently close to $a$,
$$
g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x),
$$
2) and
$$
\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = \lim_{x\to a} h(x) = L.
$$
Then
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L.
$$
The same holds for limits at $\pm\infty$ with analogous conditions.

## Intuition & Interpretation

If $f$ is squeezed between functions that both approach $L$, then $f$ cannot do
anything else but also approach $L$.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Classic trig**
$$
-1 \le \frac{\sin x}{x} \le 1 \quad (x\ne 0).
$$
With careful sign handling, one shows
$$
\cos x \le \frac{\sin x}{x} \le 1 \ \Rightarrow\ \lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin x}{x}=1.
$$

2. **Oscillation damped by a small factor**
$$
-x^2 \le x^2\sin(1/x) \le x^2 \ \Rightarrow\ \lim_{x\to0} x^2\sin(1/x) = 0.
$$

3. **Rational bounding (large $x$)**  
If
$$
\frac{x}{x+1} \le f(x) \le \frac{x}{x+2},
$$
both bounds $\to 1$; hence $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)=1$.

### Non-Examples

1. Bounds converge to **different** limits.  
2. Bounds don’t hold on a full punctured neighborhood.  
3. One side missing or reversed inequality.

## Properties & Relationships

- Fundamentally an inequality argument.  
- Pairs well with absolute‑value bounds:
$$
|f(x)| \le g(x),\ \lim g(x)=0 \ \Rightarrow\ \lim f(x)=0.
$$

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using Squeeze without verifying **both** bounds.  
2. Bounds with different limits.  
3. Missing sign considerations that break inequalities.  
4. Assuming Squeeze proves infinite limits without appropriate bounds.

## Exercises

1. Prove
$$
\lim_{x\to0} x\sin(1/x) = 0.
$$

2. If $|f(x)|\le x^4$, show
$$
\lim_{x\to0} f(x) = 0.
$$

3. Evaluate
$$
\lim_{x\to\infty} x\sin(1/x).
$$

4. **Mini‑proof** — Why must the two bounding functions converge to the **same** value?
