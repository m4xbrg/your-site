## Snapshot

The Squeeze Theorem allows the evaluation of limits when a function is trapped
between two simpler functions whose limits are known and equal. It is especially
useful when direct algebraic manipulation fails, but the function’s behavior is
nevertheless constrained.

## Formal Statement

Let $ g, f, h $ be functions defined near $ a $ (except possibly at $ a $).
Suppose:

1. For all $ x $ sufficiently close to $ a $,
```tex
g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x),
```
2. and  
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = \lim_{x\to a} h(x) = L.
```

Then the limit of the middle function exists and equals $ L $:

```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L.
The theorem also holds for limits at $ +\infty $ or $ -\infty $ with the same
```
conditions.

## Intuition & Interpretation

If a function $ f(x) $ is always sandwiched between two functions that both
approach the same limit $ L $, then $ f(x) $ cannot escape approaching $ L $
itself. The bounding functions constrain its behavior, so the only possible
limit is $ L $.

The theorem applies when the function is difficult to analyze directly but is
dominated by upper and lower bounds with clear limit behavior.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Classic trigonometric limit**
```tex
-1 \le \frac{\sin x}{x} \le 1 \quad\text{for } x\ne0.
```
   Multiply by $ x $ (positive or negative handled carefully):
```tex
\cos x \le \frac{\sin x}{x} \le 1,
and both side limits approach 1 as $ x\to0 $.
```
   Therefore:
```tex
\lim_{x\to0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1.
```

2. **Bounding a small oscillating term**
```tex
-x^2 \le x^2\sin(1/x) \le x^2.
Since both bounds approach 0 at $ x\to0 $,
```
```tex
\lim_{x\to0} x^2\sin(1/x) = 0.
```

3. **Rational bounding**
   If
```tex
\frac{x}{x+1} \le f(x) \le \frac{x}{x+2},
```
   and both bounding functions approach 1 for large $ x $, then  
```tex
\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = 1.
```

### Non-Examples

1. **Bounds do not converge to the same limit**  
   If the bounding functions approach different limits, Squeeze cannot be used.

2. **No actual inequality constraint**  
   If bounds do not hold for all sufficiently close points, theorem does not apply.

3. **One side missing or reversed**  
   Incorrect or non-monotonic inequalities invalidate the structure.

## Properties & Relationships

- The theorem is fundamentally an inequality argument.  

- Often used when direct substitution yields $ 0 \cdot (\text{oscillatory}) $

  or similar forms.  
- Connects to limits of sequences and bounding arguments in real analysis.  
- Squeeze is often paired with absolute-value bounds:
```tex
|f(x)| \le g(x),\ \lim g(x)=0 \Rightarrow \lim f(x)=0.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. Attempting to use the theorem without verifying both bounding conditions.  
2. Using bounding functions that converge to different limits.  
3. Overlooking sign changes that invalidate inequalities.  
4. Assuming Squeeze applies to infinite limits without checking bounds.

## Exercises

1. **Compute using Squeeze**
   Prove that:
```tex
\lim_{x\to0} x\sin(1/x) = 0.
```

2. **Oscillation control**
```tex
Show that if $ |f(x)|\le x^4 $, then
\lim_{x\to0} f(x) = 0.
```

3. **Large-x behavior**
   Use Squeeze to evaluate:
```tex
\lim_{x\to\infty} x\sin(1/x).
```

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**
   Explain why the two bounding functions must converge to the *same* value for
   the theorem to apply.
