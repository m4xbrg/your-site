## Definition
If $g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x)$ for all $x$ near $a$ (excluding possibly $a$), and $\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = \lim_{x\to a} h(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$. The statement holds for one-sided limits and for limits at infinity with the same bounding idea.

## Intuition
When $f$ is sandwiched tightly between two functions converging to the same target, $f$ has nowhere else to go—it must converge to that target too. This is especially useful for functions whose direct analysis is messy but whose magnitude can be bounded.

## Variants
- **Absolute value bounds:** Using $|f(x)| \le g(x)$ with $g(x)\to 0$ forces $f(x)\to 0$.
- **Limits at infinity:** Bounds that hold for large $|x|$ can show end behavior, such as $x\sin(1/x)$ near $0$ or $\dfrac{\sin x}{x}$ as $x\to\infty$.
- **Piecewise bounding:** Different bounds may be needed on different sides of $a$ before applying the theorem.

## Connections
- Complements limit laws by handling cases where algebra alone cannot resolve an indeterminate form.
- Commonly paired with trigonometric inequalities (e.g., $-1 \le \sin t \le 1$) to evaluate tricky limits.
- Provides $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proofs: once bounds are established, the shared limit yields the needed $\delta$ choices.

## Errors
- Forgetting to verify the inequality near the point of interest, not just globally.
- Bounding with functions that do not share a common limit, leaving the conclusion unjustified.
- Applying the theorem when the bounding interval excludes necessary approach directions.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What two ingredients are required to use the Squeeze Theorem?  
   **Answer:** A pair of bounding functions with a common limit and an interval where the inequalities hold near the point.
2. **Question:** How does the inequality $-1 \le \sin t \le 1$ help evaluate $\lim_{x\to 0} x\sin(1/x)$?  
   **Answer:** Multiplying by $|x|$ shows $-|x| \le x\sin(1/x) \le |x|$, and both bounds go to $0$, so the squeezed limit is $0$.
3. **Question:** Can the Squeeze Theorem handle limits at infinity?  
   **Answer:** Yes; if the bounding functions converge to the same value for large $|x|$, the middle function shares that end behavior.
