## Definition
If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and $k$ lies between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists $c$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(c)=k$. The theorem guarantees existence but not uniqueness of $c$.

## Intuition
A continuous graph cannot jump over intermediate heights. Moving from $a$ to $b$, the function must pass through every value between the starting and ending outputs, so any intermediate target is achieved somewhere in the interval.

## Variants
- **Root finding:** If $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, IVT ensures a root where $f(c)=0$.
- **Half-open intervals:** The theorem applies on closed intervals; near-endpoint continuity fails if the interval is open on one side.
- **Repeated application:** Bisection methods repeatedly apply IVT to narrow intervals containing solutions.

## Connections
- Depends on continuity on $[a,b]$, which itself is a limit-based property at every point in the interval.
- Provides existence results used in numerical methods and in proving equations have solutions without finding them explicitly.
- Complements the Extreme Value Theorem, which also requires interval continuity.

## Errors
- Applying IVT when $f$ is not continuous on the entire closed interval.
- Claiming uniqueness of solutions; IVT guarantees existence only.
- Using IVT on an open interval endpoint where one-sided continuity is missing.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What two hypotheses must hold before applying IVT on $[a,b]$?  
   **Answer:** $f$ must be continuous on $[a,b]$, and the target value $k$ must lie between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
2. **Question:** How does IVT guarantee a root when $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs?  
   **Answer:** Zero lies between the outputs, so continuity forces some $c$ with $f(c)=0$.
3. **Question:** Does IVT tell you where the solution is?  
   **Answer:** No; it ensures existence but leaves location and uniqueness to further analysis or numerical search.
