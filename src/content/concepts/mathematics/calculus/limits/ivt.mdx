## Snapshot

The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) says continuous functions on closed
intervals cannot “skip” values: if $f$ moves from one value to another, it
passes through every intermediate value.

## Formal Statement

Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$. Let $N$ be **between** $f(a)$ and $f(b)$:
$$
f(a) < N < f(b) \quad\text{or}\quad f(b) < N < f(a).
$$
Then there exists $c\in(a,b)$ with
$$
f(c) = N.
$$
This is an **existence** result (no formula for $c$ is guaranteed).

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity forbids jumps or gaps on $[a,b]$, so traversing from $f(a)$ to $f(b)$
must cross every intermediate level. Closedness ensures the function is defined
at both endpoints.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Root existence**
$$
f(x)=x^3-x-1,\quad f(1)=-1,\ f(2)=5 \ \Rightarrow\ \exists\,c\in(1,2)\ \text{s.t.}\ f(c)=0.
$$

2. **Cross a horizontal level**  
If $f(0)=2,\ f(4)=10$, then for any $N\in(2,10)$ there exists $c\in(0,4)$ with $f(c)=N$.

3. **Trigonometric continuity** — Since $\sin x$ is continuous, every value in $[-1,1]$ is achieved on intervals of length $\pi$.

### Non-Examples

1. **Discontinuous function**
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
-1,& x<0,\\
1,& x\ge0,
\end{cases}
$$
skips values; IVT does not apply.

2. **Open interval only** — On $(0,1)$ the endpoint may be undefined; IVT’s hypothesis fails.

3. **Target value not between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$** — IVT gives no guarantee.

## Properties & Relationships

- Consequence of continuity on a closed interval.  
- Supports proofs of root existence, sign-change arguments, and fixed points ($f(x)=x$).  
- Solutions may be multiple or unique depending on function shape.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Applying IVT without confirming continuity.  
2. Using endpoints incorrectly when not defined.  
3. Assuming IVT gives location/uniqueness (it doesn’t).  
4. Forgetting “between” really means *between*.

## Exercises

1. **Sign change** — Show $x^5 - 6x + 1 = 0$ has a real root.  
2. **Endpoint behavior** — If $f(0)=-4,\ f(3)=-2$, does IVT guarantee $f(x)=0$?  
3. **Existence only** — For $f(x)=\cos x - x$, show a root lies in $(0,1)$.  
4. **Mini‑proof** — Why is continuity only on $(a,b)$ not enough for the full IVT statement?
