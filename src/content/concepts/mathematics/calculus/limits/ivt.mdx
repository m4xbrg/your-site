## Snapshot

The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) states that continuous functions on closed
intervals cannot “skip” values. If a continuous function moves from one value to
another, it must pass through every intermediate value along the way.

## Formal Statement

Let \( f \) be continuous on the closed interval \( [a, b] \).  
Let \( N \) be any real number strictly between \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \); that is:

\[
f(a) < N < f(b)
\quad\text{or}\quad
f(b) < N < f(a).
\]

Then there exists some \( c \in (a, b) \) such that:

\[
f(c) = N.
\]

This is an **existence theorem**: it guarantees a point \( c \) but does not
provide a formula or construction for it.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity means no jumps or gaps.  
If the function moves from \( f(a) \) to \( f(b) \), it must pass through every
number between them.

The IVT is a structural guarantee:

- continuity prohibits “skipping over” values,
- the closed interval \( [a,b] \) ensures the function is defined everywhere
  between endpoints,
- the conclusion asserts existence but not uniqueness.

The theorem is often used to prove an equation has a solution even without
finding it.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Root existence**  
   Consider:
   \[
   f(x) = x^3 - x - 1.
   \]
   Since:
   \[
   f(1) = -1,\qquad f(2) = 5,
   \]
   and 0 lies between −1 and 5, IVT guarantees a \( c\in(1,2) \) with \( f(c)=0 \).

2. **Crossing a horizontal line**  
   If  
   \[
   f(0)=2,\quad f(4)=10,
   \]
   then for any \( N\in(2,10) \), IVT guarantees a solution to \( f(x)=N \).

3. **Trigonometric continuity**  
   Since \( \sin x \) is continuous,
   every number between −1 and 1 is achieved on any interval of length \( \pi \).

### Non-Examples

1. **Discontinuous function**
   \[
   f(x)=
   \begin{cases}
   -1,& x<0,\\
   1,& x\ge0.
   \end{cases}
   \]
   Values between −1 and 1 are skipped → IVT does not apply.

2. **Interval is not closed**
   On \( (0,1) \), continuity holds, but endpoint values may not be defined and
   IVT’s hypothesis is not satisfied.

3. **Target value not between endpoint values**
   IVT cannot assert existence for numbers outside the range between \( f(a) \)
   and \( f(b) \).

## Properties & Relationships

- IVT is a consequence of continuity on a closed interval.
- It is one of the standard characterizations of the behavior of continuous
  functions.
- The theorem supports proofs of:
  - existence of roots,
  - sign-change arguments,
  - fixed-point claims via \( f(x)=x \).

- The conclusion may produce multiple solutions or a single one depending on the
  function’s structure.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Applying IVT without confirming continuity.  
2. Using endpoints incorrectly when the function is not defined there.  
3. Assuming IVT gives the *location* of the solution or its uniqueness → it does not.  
4. Forgetting that the target value must lie **between** \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \).

## Exercises

1. **Sign change**
   Show that the equation  
   \[
   x^5 - 6x + 1 = 0
   \]
   has at least one real root using IVT.

2. **Endpoint behavior**
   Suppose:
   \[
   f(0) = -4,\quad f(3) = -2.
   \]
   Does IVT guarantee a solution to \( f(x)=0 \)? Explain.

3. **Existence only**
   Consider:
   \[
   f(x)=\cos x - x.
   \]
   Use IVT to show there exists a root in \( (0,1) \).

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**
   Explain why continuity on the open interval \( (a,b) \) is not enough for the
   full IVT statement.
