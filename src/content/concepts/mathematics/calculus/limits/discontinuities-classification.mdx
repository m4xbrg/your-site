## Snapshot

Discontinuities arise when a function fails to be continuous at a point. Limits
provide a precise way to classify the failure:

1. **Removable**  
2. **Jump**  
3. **Essential** (infinite or oscillatory)

## Formal Statement

Let $f$ be a function and $a$ a point in its domain/boundary.

### 1. Removable Discontinuity  
Occurs when the two‑sided limit exists as a finite real number, but the value at the point is missing or mismatched:
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L \quad \text{exists (finite)}, \quad \text{and} \quad f(a)\ \text{undefined or } f(a)\ne L.
$$

### 2. Jump Discontinuity  
Both one‑sided limits exist (finite) but are unequal:
$$
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) \ne \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x).
$$

### 3. Essential Discontinuity  
The limit fails for a non‑removable reason, e.g.
- one or both one‑sided limits are infinite, or  
- the function oscillates without approaching a value.

## Intuition & Interpretation

- **Removable:** local behavior is stable; the definition at the point is defective.  
- **Jump:** directional behaviors disagree; no single approach value exists.  
- **Essential:** instability (asymptotic or oscillatory) prevents convergence.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Removable (hole)**
$$
f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
$$
has a hole at $x=1$ because
$$
\lim_{x\to1} f(x)=2
$$
while $f(1)$ is undefined.

2. **Jump**
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
2,& x<0,\\
5,& x\ge 0,
\end{cases}
$$
so the one‑sided limits are $2$ and $5$.

3. **Essential (infinite)**
$$
\lim_{x\to3}\frac{1}{x-3}=\pm\infty.
$$

4. **Essential (oscillation)**
$$
f(x)=\sin(1/x)\quad \text{at } x=0.
$$

### Non-Examples

1. **Continuous** — Polynomials have no discontinuities.  
2. **Domain boundary but continuous** — $\sqrt{x}$ at $x=0$ has a right‑hand limit matching the value.  
3. **Undefined point outside closure of domain** — Classification doesn’t apply.

## Properties & Relationships

- Removable discontinuities can be repaired by redefining $f(a)$ appropriately.  
- Jump discontinuities cannot be removed.  
- Essential discontinuities include infinite and oscillatory behaviors.  
- Classification relies on **one‑sided limits**.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Calling a removable discontinuity a jump.  
2. Treating all “DNE” as the same—distinguish infinite vs oscillatory.  
3. Confusing domain endpoints with discontinuities.  
4. Checking only one side.

## Exercises

1. **Classify**
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
1,& x<1,\\
3,& x>1,
\end{cases}
$$
identify the type at $x=1$.

2. **Removable or not?**  
Classify the discontinuity of
$$
g(x)=\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}.
$$

3. **Infinite behavior**  
For
$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}
$$
classify the discontinuity at $x=0$.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)** — Explain why jump discontinuities cannot be removed by redefining $f(a)$.
