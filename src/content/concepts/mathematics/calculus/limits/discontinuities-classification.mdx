## Definition
Discontinuities are classified by how one-sided limits and function values compare at a point $a$:
- **Removable:** $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists but differs from $f(a)$ (or $f(a)$ is undefined).
- **Jump:** $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ exist but are unequal.
- **Essential:** At least one one-sided limit fails to exist or is infinite, preventing any finite limit.

## Intuition
A removable discontinuity is a hole—values approach the same height from both sides. A jump shows a sudden step between two plateau values. An essential discontinuity behaves wildly (oscillation or vertical blow-up) so there is no single nearby target.

## Variants
- **Infinite discontinuity:** Values blow up to $\pm\infty$ near the point.
- **Oscillatory essential discontinuity:** Values oscillate without narrowing, as with $\sin(1/x)$ at $0$.
- **Piecewise jumps:** Common in step functions where adjacent formulas disagree at the boundary.

## Connections
- Guides whether redefining $f(a)$ can restore continuity (only possible for removable discontinuities).
- Relates directly to one-sided limits and to the existence of two-sided limits.
- Influences applicability of the Intermediate Value Theorem, which requires continuity.

## Errors
- Calling a jump removable; differing one-sided limits cannot be fixed by redefining $f(a)$.
- Overlooking infinite behavior as a separate essential type.
- Failing to examine both sides independently when classifying.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** When is a discontinuity removable?  
   **Answer:** When both one-sided limits exist and agree, giving a finite limit that differs from $f(a)$ or where $f(a)$ is missing.
2. **Question:** What indicates a jump discontinuity in terms of limits?  
   **Answer:** The left- and right-hand limits exist but are unequal.
3. **Question:** How do you recognize an essential discontinuity caused by oscillation?  
   **Answer:** The function values keep switching without settling near any single number as $x$ approaches the point.
