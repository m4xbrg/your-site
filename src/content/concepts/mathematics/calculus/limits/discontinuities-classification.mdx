## Snapshot

Discontinuities arise when a function fails to be continuous at a point. Limits
provide a precise way to classify the failure. This leads to three fundamental
types:

1. **Removable**
2. **Jump**
3. **Essential** (infinite or oscillatory)

Each type corresponds to a specific pattern in one-sided limits and function
values.

## Formal Statement

Let $ f $ be a function and $ a $ a point in its domain or boundary.

### 1. Removable Discontinuity  
Occurs when:

```tex
- $ \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L $ exists (finite),
```
- but $ f(a) $ is either undefined or not equal to $ L $.

### 2. Jump Discontinuity  
Occurs when:

- both one-sided limits exist as finite real numbers,
- but they are unequal:
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x).
```

### 3. Essential Discontinuity  
Occurs when the limit fails for a non-removable reason, including:

- one or both one-sided limits are infinite, or  
- the function oscillates without approaching any finite value.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity depends on agreement between a function’s local behavior and its
value. Each discontinuity type corresponds to a specific kind of mismatch:

- **Removable:** behavior is fine; the definition at the point is defective.  
- **Jump:** the two sides disagree; no single approach value exists.  
- **Essential:** instability near the point prevents any form of approaching a
  single value.

This taxonomy cleanly separates structural issues in the function.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Removable (hole)**  
```tex
f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
has a hole at $ x=1 $, since $ \lim_{x\to1}f(x)=2 $ but $ f(1) $ is
```
   undefined.

2. **Jump**  
```tex
f(x)=\begin{cases}
```
2,& x<0,\\
```tex
5,& x\ge0.
\end{cases}
```
   One-sided limits are 2 and 5 → jump.

3. **Essential (infinite)**  
```tex
\lim_{x\to3}\frac{1}{x-3}=\pm\infty.
```

4. **Essential (oscillation)**  
```tex
f(x)=\sin(1/x)
```
   at $ x=0 $.

### Non-Examples

1. **Continuous points**  
   Polynomials have no discontinuities.

2. **Domain boundary without discontinuity**  
   $ \sqrt{x} $ at $ x=0 $: no discontinuity because right-hand limit equals
   value.

3. **Undefined point outside the domain**  
   If $ a $ is not in the closure of the domain, discontinuity classification
   does not apply.

## Properties & Relationships

- Removable discontinuities can be repaired by redefining $ f(a) $ appropriately.
- Jump discontinuities cannot be repaired; they reflect directional mismatch.
- Essential discontinuities indicate instability (asymptotic or oscillatory).
- Classification depends entirely on **one-sided limits**, not on algebraic
  appearance.
- Infinite limits always correspond to essential discontinuities.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Labeling a removable discontinuity as a jump.  
2. Assuming infinite limits count as “does not exist” without structure.  
3. Confusing a domain endpoint with a discontinuity.  
4. Forgetting to check both one-sided limits.

## Exercises

1. **Classify**  
   For  
```tex
f(x)=\begin{cases}
```
1,& x<1,\\
   3,& x>1,
```tex
\end{cases}
```
   identify the discontinuity type at $ x=1 $.

2. **Removable or not?**  
   Classify the discontinuity of  
```tex
g(x)=\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}.
```

3. **Infinite behavior**  
   Determine whether the discontinuity at $ x=0 $ of  
```tex
f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}
```
   is removable, jump, or essential.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Explain why jump discontinuities cannot be removed by redefining $ f(a) $.
