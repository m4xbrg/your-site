## Snapshot

Graphs and tables provide concrete evidence of how a function behaves near a
point. They reveal whether values stabilize near a number, whether sides differ,
or whether no stable limit exists.

## Formal Statement

Numerical/graphical analysis examines $f(x)$ for $x$ close to $a$ (but $x\ne a$).
Evidence suggests a limit $L$ if:

- values approach and stabilize near $L$,  
- left and right behavior is consistent,  
- the graph near $a$ matches the numerical pattern.

This is **evidence**, not a proof.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Graphs show local behavior near a point; tables approximate the same idea.
Stability near a height $L$ implies a likely limit.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Stable table values**

| $x$   | $f(x)$  |
|------:|--------:|
| 0.9   | 1.89    |
| 0.99  | 1.9899  |
| 1.01  | 2.0101  |
| 1.1   | 2.11    |

Values approach 2 from both sides → suggests
$$
\lim_{x\to1} f(x) = 2.
$$

2. **Hole but finite limit** — A removable discontinuity still has a finite limit.

3. **One‑sided differences** — If left tends to 5 and right to 7, two‑sided limit fails though one‑sided limits exist.

### Non-Examples

1. **Oscillation**
$$
\sin(1/x)\ \text{near } 0 \ \text{has no limit.}
$$

2. **Jump discontinuity** — Distinct left/right heights → no two‑sided limit.

3. **Vertical asymptote** — Divergence to $\pm\infty$ is not a finite limit.

## Properties & Relationships

- Supports algebraic analysis; distinguish removable/jump/infinite behaviors.  
- Numerical stability matters more than isolated values.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Misreading vertical scale.  
2. Treating visual appearance as proof.  
3. Using points too far from the target.  
4. Plotting artifacts (missing points).

## Exercises

1. **Numerical** — A table near $x=2$ shows 3.0001, 3.00001, 2.99999, 3.00002. What limit is suggested?

2. **Graphical** — A graph shows a hole at $x=4$ with smooth behavior; does the limit at $4$ likely exist?

3. **One‑sided analysis** — Left tends to 5, right to 8. State the situation precisely.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)** — Why can numerical evidence suggest but not prove a limit?
