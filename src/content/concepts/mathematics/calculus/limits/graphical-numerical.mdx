## Definition
A graphical or numerical estimate of $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ uses evidence from the graph near $x=a$ or from values of $f(x)$ at inputs close to $a$ (excluding $a$ itself). A consistent trend toward a single value across both sides signals the limit.

## Intuition
Zooming in on a graph near $a$ or sampling $f(x)$ values near $a$ should make the outputs cluster near the limit. If the two sides head to different numbers, the graph shows a jump; if values blow up, the graph shoots vertically; if values oscillate without narrowing, no limit appears.

## Variants
- **Table-based estimation:** Choose inputs approaching $a$ from above and below; compare the outputs.
- **Graphical zoom:** Successive zoom levels reveal whether the plotted curve straightens toward a specific height.
- **One-sided views:** When the domain is restricted, examine only the accessible side of $a$.

## Connections
- Supports the informal notion of limits by providing concrete evidence before formal proofs.
- Reveals candidate values for $L$ that can be justified using $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ or algebraic limit laws.
- Highlights discontinuities: agreement of both sides suggests continuity, disagreement suggests jumps or removable issues.

## Errors
- Reading the value at $x=a$ instead of nearby behavior, especially when a hole is present.
- Trusting a single zoom level; coarse plots can hide oscillation or vertical growth.
- Using symmetric step sizes only; asymmetric sampling may miss one-sided behavior on restricted domains.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What graphical sign indicates $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists and equals $L$?  
   **Answer:** Both sides of the graph approach the horizontal height $L$ as they near $x=a$, even if a hole appears at $a$.
2. **Question:** How can a table signal a jump discontinuity at $a$?  
   **Answer:** The left-hand values approach one number while right-hand values approach a different number.
3. **Question:** What table pattern suggests an infinite limit?  
   **Answer:** Values grow without bound in magnitude as the inputs close in on $a$.
