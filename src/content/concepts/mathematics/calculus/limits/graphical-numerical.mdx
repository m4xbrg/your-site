## Snapshot

Graphs and tables provide concrete evidence of how a function behaves near a
point. Graphical and numerical patterns can reveal whether values of a function
stabilize near a particular number, whether the behavior differs by side, or
whether no stable limit exists.

## Formal Statement

When analyzing a limit numerically or graphically, we examine the values of
\( f(x) \) for inputs \( x \) that are sufficiently close to \( a \), but not
equal to \( a \). A limit \( L \) is suggested if:

- values of \( f(x) \) approach and stabilize near \( L \),
- both left-hand and right-hand behavior appears consistent,
- graphical behavior near the point aligns with numerical evidence.

These interpretations do *not* constitute a proof; they provide evidence that
must be verified algebraically or using formal definitions when required.

## Intuition & Interpretation

A graph shows the local behavior of a function near a point. If the function's
values converge toward a horizontal height \( L \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \),
the graph visually confirms the existence of a limit.

Tables approximate the same idea: they show how values behave as inputs move
closer to the limit point. Stability of values—not isolated points—indicates the
existence of a limit.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Stable table values**

| \(x\) | \(f(x)\) |
|------|----------|
| 0.9  | 1.89     |
| 0.99 | 1.9899   |
| 1.01 | 2.0101   |
| 1.1  | 2.11     |

Values approach 2 from both sides → graphical and numerical evidence suggest  
\[
\lim_{x\to1} f(x) = 2.
\]

2. **Graph approaching a point despite a hole**  
A removable discontinuity at \( x = 3 \) still shows the graph approaching a
single height, indicating the limit exists.

3. **One-sided differences**  
If left-hand values stabilize near 5 and right-hand values near 7, the graph
shows no two-sided limit but *does* show one-sided limits.

### Non-Examples

1. **Oscillation**  
Graph of \( \sin(1/x) \) near 0 shows dense oscillations with no stability →  
limit does not exist.

2. **Jump discontinuity**  
A sudden vertical jump between two heights on a graph indicates distinct one-sided
limits, so two-sided limit fails.

3. **Vertical asymptote behavior**  
Values diverging to \( +\infty \) or \( -\infty \) indicate an infinite limit, not
a finite limit.

## Properties & Relationships

- Graphical evidence often supports algebraic simplification steps.
- Numerical tables are sensitive to rounding; stability is more important than
specific numerical values.
- Graphs help distinguish:
  - removable discontinuities,
  - jump discontinuities,
  - infinite discontinuities,
  - infinite limits,
  - stable vs. unstable oscillations.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Misreading vertical scale (small differences appear large or vice versa).  
2. Relying on graph appearance without checking algebraic consistency.  
3. Assuming limited numerical precision proves a limit exists.  
4. Using points too far from the limit point.  
5. Misinterpreting plotting artifacts (e.g., missing points).

## Exercises

1. **Numerical**  
   A table shows values of a function near \( x = 2 \) approaching  
   3.0001, 3.00001, 2.99999, 3.00002. What limit does this suggest?

2. **Graphical**  
   A graph shows a hole at \( x = 4 \) but smooth behavior around it.  
   Describe whether the limit at 4 likely exists and explain why.

3. **One-sided analysis**  
   A graph shows the left-hand approach to 5 and the right-hand approach to 8.  
   Determine whether the limit exists, and describe the situation precisely.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Explain why numerical evidence can suggest but not prove the existence of a limit.
