## Definition
The limit $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = L$ means that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is an $M$ such that $x > M$ implies $|f(x)-L| < \varepsilon$. A similar definition applies to $x\to -\infty$. Finite limits at infinity indicate horizontal asymptotes at height $L$.

## Intuition
As $x$ grows large in magnitude, only dominant terms of $f(x)$ matter. If those terms balance to a constant, the function flattens toward that value; if they dominate without bound, the limit is infinite or does not exist.

## Variants
- **Rational functions:** Compare degrees of numerator and denominator to predict the limit.
- **Exponential growth/decay:** Exponentials dominate polynomials, leading to infinite limits or zero limits depending on sign.
- **Oscillatory functions:** Functions like $\sin x$ lack limits at infinity because outputs keep swinging.

## Connections
- Complements infinite limits, which look at unbounded function values near finite points.
- Dominant-term reasoning parallels series and asymptotic analysis in later courses.
- Horizontal asymptotes from limits at infinity aid graphing and understanding end behavior.

## Errors
- Assuming any function with a horizontal asymptote must cross it; limits describe approach, not intersection.
- Ignoring sign when comparing dominant terms, leading to wrong $\pm\infty$ conclusions.
- Claiming a limit exists at infinity without verifying stabilization across large magnitudes.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What does $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = L$ say about $f(x)$ for large $x$?  
   **Answer:** That $f(x)$ stays within any desired tolerance of $L$ once $x$ exceeds some bound.
2. **Question:** How do you find $\lim_{x\to\infty} \dfrac{3x^2+1}{x^2-4}$?  
   **Answer:** Compare leading terms; the ratio of coefficients gives the limit $3$.
3. **Question:** Why does $\lim_{x\to\infty} \sin x$ not exist?  
   **Answer:** The values keep oscillating between $-1$ and $1$ without settling toward a single number.
