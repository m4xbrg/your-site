## Snapshot

Limits at infinity describe the behavior of a function as the input grows without
bound. If \( f(x) \) approaches a finite value as \( x\to\pm\infty \), that value
defines a horizontal asymptote. These limits reveal long-range behavior rather
than local behavior near a finite point.

## Formal Statement

We write:

\[
\lim_{x\to +\infty} f(x) = L
\]

to mean that as \( x \) becomes arbitrarily large, the values of \( f(x) \)
become arbitrarily close to \( L \).

Similarly:

\[
\lim_{x\to -\infty} f(x) = L
\]

describes behavior as \( x \) becomes arbitrarily large in magnitude but
negative.

A **horizontal asymptote** is defined by:

\[
y = L \quad\text{if}\quad
\lim_{x\to\pm\infty} f(x) = L.
\]

Dominant-term reasoning is commonly used for rational functions:

- If degrees match: limit = ratio of leading coefficients.  
- If numerator degree < denominator degree: limit = 0.  
- If numerator degree > denominator degree: limit = ±∞ (no horizontal asymptote).

## Intuition & Interpretation

Limits at infinity analyze the eventual, long-range stabilization of a function.
The key idea: **local irregularities are irrelevant**. Only the dominant
structure of the expression matters for large \( x \).

Horizontal asymptotes describe the “end behavior” of a graph—how the function
settles as \( x \) grows beyond any finite bound.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Matching degrees**  
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{3x^2 - x}{6x^2 + 1} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

2. **Degree of denominator larger**  
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = 0.
\]

3. **Degree of numerator larger**  
\[
\lim_{x\to -\infty} \frac{x^3 + 1}{2x^2 - 5} = -\infty.
\]

4. **Exponential dominates polynomial**  
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0.
\]

### Non-Examples

1. **Oscillatory functions with no stabilization**  
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} \sin(x)
\]
does not exist.

2. **Infinite limit at finite point**  
Not a limit at infinity; belongs to infinite limits.

3. **Piecewise behavior that does not stabilize**  
If long-range values keep alternating without convergence, no horizontal asymptote exists.

## Properties & Relationships

- Dominant terms determine the behavior for polynomials and rational functions.  
- Horizontal asymptotes describe global, not local, structure.  
- Exponential, logarithmic, and polynomial families have predictable dominance
  relationships.  
- Limits at infinity relate closely to growth rates and comparisons of function families.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming horizontal asymptotes restrict the function from crossing them.  
2. Applying finite-point limit rules directly without checking dominance.  
3. Forgetting to consider sign for \( x\to -\infty \).  
4. Misidentifying rational-function degrees.

## Exercises

1. **Compute**  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5x^3 - x}{10x^3 + 2}.
   \]

2. **Dominant-term check**  
   Determine  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to-\infty} \frac{7x^2}{3x^3 -1}.
   \]

3. **Conceptual**  
   Explain why a rational function with denominator degree one higher always has a horizontal asymptote at 0.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Prove that if  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = L,
   \]
   then \( y=L \) is a horizontal asymptote.
