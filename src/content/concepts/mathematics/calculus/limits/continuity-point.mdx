## Snapshot

A function is continuous at a point if the function value matches the limit at
that point. Continuity captures the idea of “no breaks” or “no interruptions” in
the function’s behavior at a specific location.

## Formal Statement

A function f is **continuous at a** if all three of the following hold:

1. f(a) is defined.  
2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a exists as a finite real number.  
   In symbols: lim f(x) (as x -> a) exists.  
3. The limit agrees with the value at the point:  

   lim f(x) (as x -> a) = f(a).

Equivalently, in terms of one-sided limits:

- The left-hand limit lim f(x) (as x -> a from the left) exists.  
- The right-hand limit lim f(x) (as x -> a from the right) exists.  
- Both one-sided limits and the function value coincide:

  left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(a).

Continuity at a point requires both agreement of directional behavior and
agreement with the function value at that point.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity at a point means:

- if you walk toward a along the x-axis,  
- the outputs f(x) settle down to a single value L,  
- and the actual value of the function at a is also L.

The limit describes **approach behavior**. Continuity requires that this approach
behavior and the actual value at the point align.

Key separation:

- Existence of a limit is about values *near* a.  
- Definition at a is about the single value f(a).  
- Continuity is about their agreement.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Polynomial continuity**

   Let f(x) = x^2 + 1.  
   At x = 3:

   - f(3) = 10,  
   - lim f(x) (as x -> 3) = 10 (by direct substitution, polynomials are continuous).  

   Therefore, f is continuous at 3.

2. **Removable discontinuity repaired**

   Define:

   - g(x) = (x^2 - 1) / (x - 1) for x not equal to 1,  
   - g(1) = 2.

   The limit of (x^2 - 1) / (x - 1) as x -> 1 is 2.  
   By defining g(1) = 2, the function becomes continuous at 1.

3. **Absolute value at 0**

   For f(x) = |x|, both one-sided limits at 0 equal 0 and f(0) = 0, so f is continuous at 0.

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump discontinuity**

   A function that takes value 1 for x < 0 and 5 for x >= 0 has a jump at 0:  
   left-hand and right-hand limits are different, so there is no single limit and thus no continuity.

2. **Infinite discontinuity**

   For f(x) = 1 / (x - 2), as x -> 2 the values blow up without bound.  
   No finite limit exists, so the function is not continuous at 2.

3. **Undefined value but finite limit**

   If lim f(x) (as x -> a) exists but f(a) is not defined, the function fails the first condition of continuity.

## Properties & Relationships

- Continuity at a point is a local property: it only depends on behavior arbitrarily close to that point.  
- Continuous functions preserve convergence: if x_n -> a, then f(x_n) -> f(a) whenever f is continuous at a.  
- Standard functions used in calculus (polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, and their combinations) are continuous on their domains.  
- Continuity at each point of an interval defines continuity on that interval and enables theorems like the Intermediate Value Theorem.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming that having a limit at a point is automatically the same as being continuous there.  
2. Forgetting to check whether f(a) is actually defined.  
3. Overlooking the possibility that the limit exists but is different from f(a).  
4. Confusing removable discontinuities (which can be fixed by redefining f(a)) with jump or essential discontinuities (which cannot be fixed by changing a single value).

## Exercises

1. **Compute and decide continuity**

   Let

   f(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) for x not equal to 2, and f(2) = 4.

   a. Compute lim f(x) as x -> 2.  
   b. Compare this limit to f(2).  
   c. Is f continuous at 2?

2. **Check definition conditions**

   Suppose h has a finite limit at a, but h(a) is undefined.  

   a. Does h satisfy the definition of continuity at a?  
   b. How could you modify h at a to make it continuous?

3. **Limit vs value**

   Can a function have lim f(x) as x -> a not equal to f(a) and still be continuous at a?  
   Explain, using the formal definition.

4. **One-sided version**

   Let f be defined and continuous on the half-interval [0, infinity).  
   Explain how to state the continuity condition at 0 using a one-sided limit.
