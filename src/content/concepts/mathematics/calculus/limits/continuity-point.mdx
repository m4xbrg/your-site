title: Continuity at a Point
summary: >
  A function is continuous at a point when the limit equals the function value
  there, capturing the idea that no jump, hole, or asymptotic behavior occurs at
  that location.

## Snapshot

A function is continuous at a point if the function value matches the limit at
that point. Continuity captures the idea of “no breaks” in behavior at a specific
location.

## Formal Statement

A function $f$ is **continuous at $a$** if:

1) $f(a)$ is defined,  
2) the limit exists,
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) \ \text{ exists},
$$
3) and they agree:
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a).
$$

Equivalently, using one‑sided limits:
$$
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
$$

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity means evaluating the function at the point gives the same result as
approaching the point through arbitrarily small neighborhoods. Distinguish:

- **limit behavior** (approach),  
- **point value** (evaluation),  
- **agreement** (continuity).

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Polynomial**
$$
\lim_{x\to3} (x^2+1) = (3)^2+1 = 10 = f(3).
$$

2. **Removable discontinuity corrected**  
Let $g(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$. Redefining $g(1)=2$ yields continuity at $1$.

3. **Absolute value**  
$|x|$ is continuous at $0$ since left and right limits are $0$.

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump** — Left and right limits differ.  
2. **Infinite** — If
$$
\lim_{x\to1} \frac{1}{x-1} = \pm\infty,
$$
there is no finite limit → not continuous.  
3. **Undefined at the point** — If $f(a)$ does not exist, continuity is impossible.

## Properties & Relationships

- Continuity requires, but is not guaranteed by, existence of the limit.  
- Polynomials, exponentials, and rational functions (on their domains) are continuous.  
- Continuity is **local**; only behavior near the point matters.  
- Builds to continuity on intervals.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming limit existence implies continuity.  
2. Forgetting $f(a)$ must exist.  
3. Overlooking $f(a)\ne \lim f$ mismatches.  
4. Confusing removable with essential discontinuities.

## Exercises

1. **Compute + evaluate**  
For
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}, & x\neq 2,\\
5, & x=2,
\end{cases}
$$
is $f$ continuous at $x=2$?

2. **One-sided check**
$$
\lim_{x\to 3^-} |x-3| \quad\text{and}\quad \lim_{x\to 3^+} |x-3|.
$$
Is $|x-3|$ continuous at $3$?

3. **Conceptual** — Can a function be discontinuous at $a$ even if the two‑sided limit exists?

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)** — If both one‑sided limits equal $L$ and $f(a)=L$, then $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=f(a)$.
