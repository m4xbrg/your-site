## Snapshot

A function is continuous at a point if the function value matches the limit at
that point. Continuity captures the idea of “no breaks” or “no interruptions” in
the function’s behavior at a specific location.

## Formal Statement

A function f is **continuous at a** if:

1. f(a) is defined,  
2. lim_{x→a} f(x) exists as a finite real number, and  
3. these quantities are equal:

lim_{x→a} f(x) = f(a).

Equivalently, in terms of one-sided limits:

- lim_{x→a^-} f(x) exists,  
- lim_{x→a^+} f(x) exists,  
- and lim_{x→a^-} f(x) = lim_{x→a^+} f(x) = f(a).

Continuity at a point requires both **agreement of directional behavior** and
**agreement with the function value** at that point.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity at a point means that evaluating the function at that point produces
the same result as taking a limit there. The function’s local behavior is
consistent with its actual value.

This is more than just having a limit:

- The limit must exist.  
- The function must be defined at the point.  
- The value at the point must equal the limiting value.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Polynomial continuity**

   For f(x) = x² + 1, the function is continuous everywhere.  
   At x = 3:

   - f(3) = 10,  
   - lim_{x→3} f(x) = 10,  

   so f is continuous at 3.

2. **Removable discontinuity repaired**

   Define

   - g(x) = (x² - 1) / (x - 1) for x ≠ 1,  
   - g(1) = 2.

   The limit of (x² - 1) / (x - 1) as x→1 is 2, and the function value is set to 2,
   so g is continuous at 1.

3. **Absolute value function**

   f(x) = |x| is continuous at 0.  
   Both one-sided limits equal 0, and f(0) = 0.

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump discontinuity**

   If the left and right limits at a are different, then no single limit exists,
   and continuity fails.

2. **Infinite discontinuity**

   If f blows up to +∞ or -∞ near a, no finite limit exists, so continuity fails.

3. **Undefined value**

   If f(a) does not exist, the function cannot be continuous at a, even if the
   limit exists.

## Properties & Relationships

- Continuity at a point depends only on behavior near that point; global behavior
  is irrelevant.
- Continuous functions preserve limits of sequences: if x_n→a and f is continuous
  at a, then f(x_n)→f(a).
- Polynomials, exponentials, and rational functions (on their domains) are
  continuous everywhere they are defined.
- Continuity at each point in an interval defines continuity on that interval.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming that the existence of lim_{x→a} f(x) automatically implies continuity.  
2. Ignoring whether f(a) is defined.  
3. Overlooking mismatches where the limit exists but differs from f(a).  
4. Confusing removable discontinuities (with a fixable hole) and non-removable
   ones (jump or essential).

## Exercises

1. **Compute and decide continuity**

   Let

   f(x) = (x² - 4) / (x - 2) for x ≠ 2, and f(2) = 4.

   a. Compute lim_{x→2} (x² - 4) / (x - 2).  
   b. Compare this limit to f(2).  
   c. Is f continuous at 2?

2. **Check definition conditions**

   Suppose h has a finite limit at a, but h(a) is undefined.  
   a. Does h satisfy the definition of continuity at a?  
   b. How could h be modified at a to make it continuous?

3. **Different limits, same value**

   Can a function have lim_{x→a} f(x) ≠ f(a) but still be called continuous at a?  
   Justify your answer with the formal definition.

4. **One-sided continuity**

   Let f be defined on [0, ∞) and continuous there.  
   Explain how continuity at 0 should be formulated in terms of a one-sided limit.
