## Definition
A function $f$ is continuous at $a$ if $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists and equals $f(a)$. Equivalently, both one-sided limits exist, agree, and match the function value, so approaching $a$ causes no jump or hole.

## Intuition
Continuity means no surprises when you reach $a$: the graph has no break, and numerical values flow smoothly into $f(a)$. If the limit exists but differs from $f(a)$ or $f(a)$ is undefined, the point is discontinuous.

## Variants
- **Endpoint continuity:** At domain endpoints, continuity uses the appropriate one-sided limit.
- **Removable discontinuity:** The limit exists but differs from $f(a)$; redefining $f(a)$ to the limit repairs continuity.
- **Essential discontinuity:** One-sided limits disagree or fail to exist; no single value of $f(a)$ can fix it.

## Connections
- Continuity on an interval requires continuity at every point of the interval.
- Differentiability implies continuity; continuity allows application of the Intermediate Value Theorem.
- Classifying discontinuities relies on comparing limits to the function value.

## Errors
- Checking only $f(a)$ without verifying the limit from nearby points.
- Assuming piecewise-defined functions are continuous at the boundary without matching one-sided limits.
- Forgetting to adjust the definition at endpoints to use one-sided limits.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What three conditions must hold for continuity at $a$?  
   **Answer:** $f(a)$ is defined, $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists, and the limit equals $f(a)$.
2. **Question:** How can a removable discontinuity at $a$ be fixed?  
   **Answer:** Redefine $f(a)$ to equal $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$.
3. **Question:** What does it mean if $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) \ne \lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$?  
   **Answer:** The two-sided limit and continuity at $a$ both fail because the directional behaviors differ.
