## Snapshot

A function is continuous at a point if the function value matches the limit at
that point. Continuity captures the idea of “no breaks” or “no interruptions” in
the function’s behavior at a specific location.

## Formal Statement

A function \( f \) is **continuous at \( a \)** if:

1. \( f(a) \) is defined,  
2. \( \lim_{x\to a} f(x) \) exists, and  
3. these quantities are equal:

\[
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a).
\]

Equivalently, using one-sided limits:

\[
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
\]

Continuity at the point requires both agreement of directional behavior and
agreement with the value at the point.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity indicates that evaluating the function at the point produces the
same result as approaching the point through arbitrarily small neighborhoods.

The limit must describe stable behavior near the point. The function must also
produce that same value when evaluated directly.

This distinguishes:

- **limit behavior** (approach),  
- **point behavior** (value),  
- **agreement** (continuity).

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Polynomial continuity**  
   \( f(x)=x^2+1 \) is continuous everywhere, and  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to3} f(x)=f(3)=10.
   \]

2. **Removable discontinuity corrected**  
   \[
   g(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
   \]
   has a hole at \( x=1 \).  
   Redefining \( g(1)=2 \) creates continuity.

3. **Absolute value continuity**  
   \( f(x)=|x| \) is continuous at 0: both one-sided limits equal 0.

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump discontinuity**  
   Left and right limits differ → not continuous.

2. **Infinite discontinuity**  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to1} \frac{1}{x-1}=\pm\infty
   \]
   → limit does not exist as a real number → not continuous.

3. **Function undefined at the point**  
   If \( f(a) \) does not exist, continuity is impossible.

## Properties & Relationships

- Continuity requires but is not guaranteed by:  
  - existence of the limit,  
  - existence of the function value.
- All polynomials, exponentials, and rational functions (on their domains) are continuous.
- Continuity is **local**: only behavior near the point matters.
- Continuity at a point is the building block for continuity on intervals.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming existence of a limit implies continuity.  
2. Forgetting that function must be defined at the point.  
3. Overlooking mismatches between function value and limit value.  
4. Confusing removable and non-removable discontinuities.

## Exercises

1. **Compute + evaluate**  
   For  
   \[
   f(x)=\begin{cases}
   \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}, & x\neq2,\\
   5, & x=2,
   \end{cases}
   \]
   determine whether \( f \) is continuous at \( x=2 \).

2. **One-sided check**  
   Determine whether  
   \[
   h(x)=|x-3|
   \]
   is continuous at \( x=3 \).

3. **Conceptual**  
   Can a function be discontinuous at a point even if the limit exists there?

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Show that if both one-sided limits equal \( L \) and \( f(a)=L \), then  
   \( \lim_{x\to a} f(x)=f(a) \), proving continuity at \( a \).
