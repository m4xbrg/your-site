## Definition
Limit laws assert that if $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a} g(x)$ exist and are finite, then
- $\lim_{x\to a} (f+g)(x) = \lim f + \lim g$,
- $\lim_{x\to a} (f-g)(x) = \lim f - \lim g$,
- $\lim_{x\to a} (cf)(x) = c\,\lim f$ for any constant $c$,
- $\lim_{x\to a} (fg)(x) = (\lim f)(\lim g)$,
- $\lim_{x\to a} \dfrac{f}{g}(x) = \dfrac{\lim f}{\lim g}$ when $\lim g \ne 0$,
- $\lim_{x\to a} [f(x)]^n = (\lim f)^n$ for integer $n$, and more generally $\lim_{x\to a} F(f(x)) = F(\lim f)$ when $F$ is continuous at the limit value.

## Intuition
These rules mirror familiar algebra because limits capture nearby behavior: if both functions stabilize near numbers, combining them algebraically yields outputs stabilizing near the algebraic combination of those numbers.

## Variants
- **Composition law:** Substitute limits into continuous outer functions (e.g., polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions).
- **Root law:** $\lim_{x\to a} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{\lim f}$ when the root is defined near the limit.
- **Indeterminate forms:** Laws do not directly resolve $0/0$ or $\infty/\infty$, which require algebraic rewriting or additional theorems.

## Connections
- Provide the primary toolkit for evaluating limits before invoking the Squeeze Theorem or $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proofs.
- Underlie proofs of continuity for algebraic and elementary functions because continuity at $a$ means the limit equals the function value.
- Support computation strategies such as factoring, rationalizing, or using trig identities to expose standard limits.

## Errors
- Applying quotient laws when the denominator limit is $0$ without further analysis.
- Substituting into a discontinuous outer function (e.g., absolute value at a kink) without checking one-sided behavior.
- Assuming limit laws handle oscillatory or divergent components; existing finite limits are required hypotheses.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** When can you replace $\lim_{x\to a} F(f(x))$ with $F(\lim_{x\to a} f(x))$?  
   **Answer:** When $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists and $F$ is continuous at that limit value.
2. **Question:** Why is $\lim_{x\to a} \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ not determined by the quotient law if $\lim_{x\to a} g(x)=0$?  
   **Answer:** The law requires a nonzero denominator limit; when it is zero the behavior may be finite, infinite, or undefined and needs separate analysis.
3. **Question:** Which law justifies $\lim_{x\to a} [f(x)]^3 = (\lim_{x\to a} f(x))^3$?  
   **Answer:** The power law, a special case of composition with the continuous function $F(t)=t^3$.
