## Snapshot

The algebraic limit laws describe how limits behave under standard operations,
allowing evaluation by decomposing expressions into simpler components.

## Formal Statement

Assume
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L,\qquad \lim_{x\to a} g(x)=M,
$$
and required hypotheses hold (finiteness, nonzero denominators, etc.). Then:

1. **Sum**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} (f+g) = L+M.
$$

2. **Difference**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} (f-g) = L-M.
$$

3. **Constant multiple** (for constant $c$)
$$
\lim_{x\to a} c\,f = cL.
$$

4. **Product**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} (fg) = LM.
$$

5. **Quotient** (if $M\ne 0$)
$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f}{g} = \frac{L}{M}.
$$

6. **Power** (integer $n\ge 1$)
$$
\lim_{x\to a} \big(f(x)\big)^n = L^n.
$$

7. **Root** (even $n$ requires $f\ge 0$ near $a$)
$$
\lim_{x\to a} \sqrt[n]{\,f(x)\,} = \sqrt[n]{\,L\,}.
$$

## Intuition & Interpretation

When $f$ and $g$ stabilize near $a$, their algebraic combinations stabilize in
the corresponding algebraic ways, provided no undefined expressions arise.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1.
$$
\lim_{x\to 2} (3x + 5) = 11.
$$

2.
$$
\lim_{x\to -1} (x^2 - 4x) = 5.
$$

3.
$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{2}{-3}
\quad\text{if}\quad \lim f=2,\ \lim g=-3.
$$

4.
$$
\lim_{x\to 1} (x+1)^3 = 8.
$$

### Non-Examples (Misuses)

1. **Quotient when $\lim g=0$** — Not applicable (e.g., $\lim_{x\to 0}1/x$).  
2. **$0/0$ forms** — Must simplify first (e.g., $\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$).  
3. **Product with divergence** — If either factor has no limit, product law fails.  
4. **Root without sign check** — Even roots require nonnegativity near $a$.

## Properties & Relationships

- Consequences of the $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definition.  
- Foundation for many techniques (e.g., L’Hôpital, series).  
- Determine behavior for polynomials/rationals except at denominator zeros.  
- Interacts with continuity and the squeeze theorem.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Applying quotient law with $M=0$.  
2. Ignoring domain/branch constraints for roots.  
3. Treating product of limits as a limit of products when one factor diverges.  
4. Using laws before addressing $0/0$ indeterminacy.  
5. Assuming a law applies without verifying hypotheses.

## Exercises

1. Evaluate
$$
\lim_{x\to 3} (5x^2 - 4x + 1).
$$

2. Given $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=7$ and $\lim_{x\to a} g(x)=-2$, compute
$$
\lim_{x\to a} \big(3f(x) - 5g(x)\big).
$$

3. Explain why the quotient law cannot be applied directly to
$$
\lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}.
$$

4. Describe a situation where the product law does **not** apply even though both functions are defined near $a$.

5. **Sketch** — Prove the sum law with $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ bounds.
