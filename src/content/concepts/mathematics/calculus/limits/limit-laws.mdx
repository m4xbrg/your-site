## Snapshot

The algebraic limit laws describe how limits behave under basic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.  
They allow the evaluation of many limits by breaking down a complicated expression
into simpler components whose limits are easier to compute.

## Formal Statement

```tex
Let $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L $ and $ \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = M $, and assume all
```
limits below exist (and, when required, are finite). Then:

1. **Sum Law**  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} \big(f(x) + g(x)\big) = L + M.
```
$$

2. **Difference Law**  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} \big(f(x) - g(x)\big) = L - M.
```
$$

3. **Constant Multiple Law**  
   For any constant $ c $,  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} (c\,f(x)) = cL.
```
$$

4. **Product Law**  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} \big(f(x)g(x)\big) = LM.
```
$$

5. **Quotient Law**  
```tex
   If $ M \neq 0 $,  
```
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{L}{M}.
```
$$

6. **Power Law**  
   For any positive integer $ n $,  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} \big(f(x)\big)^n = L^n.
```
$$

7. **Root Law**  
```tex
   If $ n $ is even, assume $ f(x) \ge 0 $ near $ a $; then  
```
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{L}.
```
$$

These rules may require additional conditions when $ f(x) $ or $ g(x) $
approach infinite or undefined values. The statements above concern the finite,
well-defined case.

## Intuition & Interpretation

The limit operation is compatible with standard algebraic operations.  
If two functions approach specific values near a point, then combining those
functions algebraically produces a new function whose limit is the corresponding
algebraic combination of the original limits.

The laws formalize the idea that “limit-taking commutes with algebra” when the
individual limits behave well and no undefined expressions arise (such as
division by zero).

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1.  
   $ \lim_{x\to 2} (3x + 5) = 3\lim_{x\to 2} x + 5 = 3(2) + 5 = 11. $

2.  
   $ \lim_{x\to -1} (x^2 - 4x) = \lim x^2 - 4\lim x = (-1)^2 - 4(-1) = 5. $

3.  
```tex
   If $ \lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = 2 $ and $ \lim_{x\to 0} g(x) = -3 $, then  
```
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{2}{-3}.
```
$$

4.  
   $ \lim_{x\to 1} (x+1)^3 = (\lim_{x\to 1}(x+1))^3 = 2^3 = 8. $

### Non-Examples (Important Misuses)

1. **Division Law misuse:**  
```tex
   If $ \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = 0 $, the quotient law *does not apply*.  
```
```tex
   Example: $ \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{x} $ is not finite.
```

2. **Undefined expressions:**  
   $ \lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} $  
   Both numerator and denominator approach 0 → quotient law cannot be used until
   expression is simplified.

3. **Product of divergent limits:**  
   If either $ f(x) $ or $ g(x) $ diverges, the product law does not apply.

4. **Root Law misuse:**  
   Even roots require non-negativity near the limit point; otherwise limit does not
   follow by the root law.

## Properties & Relationships

- The algebraic limit laws follow from the epsilon–delta definition of limit.  
- They are the foundation for more advanced limit techniques (e.g. L’Hôpital, series).  
- Together they imply limit behavior is fully determined for all polynomial and rational functions except where denominators vanish.  
- The laws permit reduction of complex limits to simpler pieces whose limits are
  known.  
- They interact with:
  - **Continuity:** continuous functions satisfy all limit laws inherently.  
  - **Squeeze theorem:** a complementary tool when limit laws alone are insufficient.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Applying the quotient law when the denominator limit is zero.  
2. Forgetting to check domain constraints for root laws.  
3. Assuming laws apply when one or more component limits diverge.  
4. Using algebraic laws before simplifying indeterminate forms like $ 0/0 $.  
5. Treating the limit of a product as the product of limits when one function has no limit.

## Exercises

1. **Compute**  
```tex
   Evaluate $ \lim_{x\to 3} (5x^2 - 4x + 1) $.
```

2. **Compute**  
```tex
   Given $ \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = 7 $ and $ \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = -2 $, compute  
```
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} (3f(x) - 5g(x)).
```
$$

3. **Investigate a failure mode**  
   Explain why the quotient law cannot be applied directly to  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}.
```
$$

4. **Conceptual**  
   Describe a situation in which the product law does *not* apply even though
   $ f(x) $ and $ g(x) $ are individually well-defined near the point.

5. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Prove the sum law using the epsilon–delta definition.

## Proof Sketch / Proof

A proof for each algebraic law follows from the epsilon–delta definition.
```tex
As a sketch, for the **sum law**, assume $ \lim f = L $ and $ \lim g = M $.  
```
```tex
Given $ \varepsilon > 0 $, choose
```
$$
```tex
\delta = \min(\delta_f, \delta_g),
```
$$
```tex
where $ \delta_f $ and $ \delta_g $ bound the deviations
```
$ |f(x)-L| < \varepsilon/2 $ and $ |g(x)-M| < \varepsilon/2 $.  
Then
$$
|(f(x)+g(x)) - (L+M)|  
```tex
\le |f(x)-L| + |g(x)-M| < \varepsilon.
```
$$
Thus the sum law holds; analogous arguments handle the remaining laws.
