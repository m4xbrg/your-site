## Snapshot

Basic epsilon–delta proofs demonstrate how to use the formal definition of a
limit to verify statements for simple functions. The core technique is to derive
a bound of the form:

$$
```tex
|f(x) - L| \le C |x - a|,
```
$$

```tex
and then choose $ \delta = \varepsilon / C $ (or any suitable expression).
```
This establishes the ε–δ relationship required by the definition.

## Formal Statement

To prove a limit using the epsilon–delta definition, we must show:

$$
```tex
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0
```
```tex
\ \text{such that}\ 
```
```tex
0 < |x-a| < \delta \ \Longrightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon.
```
$$

For linear functions $ f(x)=mx+b $, the proof reduces to:

$$
|f(x) - L| = |m||x-a|.
$$

Thus choosing:

$$
```tex
\delta = \varepsilon / |m|
```
$$

satisfies the definition.

```tex
For constant functions, any $ \delta>0 $ works.
```

## Intuition & Interpretation

Epsilon–delta proofs follow a consistent structure:

1. **Start with the target inequality:**  
```tex
   Make $ |f(x)-L| < \varepsilon $ resemble something involving $ |x-a| $.
```

2. **Factor or simplify the expression:**  
   Translate $ |f(x)-L| $ into a multiple of $ |x-a| $.

3. **Select a delta bound:**  
```tex
   Solve the inequality $ C|x-a| < \varepsilon $ for $ |x-a| $.
```

4. **Verify the implication:**  
```tex
   Confirm that $ |x-a|<\delta $ gives the desired bound.
```

This provides a template usable for many elementary limits.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Linear function**
   Prove:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to2} (3x+1) = 7.
```
$$

   Compute:
   $$
|(3x+1)-7| = |3||x-2|.
$$
   Choose:
   $$
```tex
\delta = \varepsilon / 3.
```
$$

2. **Constant function**
   For $ f(x)=5 $:
   $$
```tex
|f(x)-5|=0<\varepsilon.
```
$$
```tex
   Any $ \delta>0 $ works.
```

3. **Quadratic using bounding**
   To show:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to1} x^2 = 1,
```
$$
   rewrite:
   $$
|x^2-1| = |x-1||x+1|.
$$
```tex
   If we restrict $ |x-1|<1 $, then $ x\in(0,2) $, so $ |x+1|<3 $.  
```
   Thus:
   $$
|x^2-1| < 3|x-1|.
$$
```tex
   Choose $ \delta = \min\{1, \varepsilon/3\} $.
```

### Non-Examples

1. **Limits not finite**  
   The epsilon–delta definition applies only to finite limits.

2. **Oscillatory functions at certain points**  
```tex
   Functions like $ \sin(1/x) $ near 0 cannot be handled with a single delta.
```

3. **Using circular reasoning**  
```tex
   Starting from the inequality $ |x-a|<\delta \Rightarrow |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon $
```
   without deriving delta is invalid.

## Properties & Relationships

- Linear proofs require direct factoring.  
- Quadratic and polynomial proofs require bounding auxiliary terms (e.g., $ |x+1| $).  
- Epsilon–delta proofs establish limit laws rigorously.  
- Proof structure generalizes to continuity proofs.

## Common Pitfalls

```tex
1. Choosing $ \delta $ before deriving the relationship.  
```
2. Using inequalities that include the value $ x=a $ incorrectly.  
```tex
3. Forgetting to include the condition $ 0<|x-a|<\delta $.  
```
4. Failing to bound auxiliary expressions before delta selection.

## Exercises

1. **Linear proof**
   Prove:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to -1} (4x-2) = -6.
```
$$

2. **Quadratic with bounding**
   Prove:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to 2} (x^2) = 4.
```
$$

3. **Delta derivation**
   Suppose:
   $$
```tex
|f(x)-L| \le 7|x-a|.
```
$$
```tex
   What $ \delta $ works for a given $ \varepsilon $?
```

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**
   Explain why any constant function satisfies the epsilon–delta definition at every point.
