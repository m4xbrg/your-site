## Definition
An $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proof shows $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$ by starting with an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$, proposing a specific $\delta>0$, and verifying that $0<|x-a|<\delta$ forces $|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$. The heart of the proof is bounding $|f(x)-L|$ by expressions involving $|x-a|$.

## Intuition
Work backward: express $|f(x)-L|$ in terms of $|x-a|$ and constants, then choose $\delta$ small enough to make the bound fall below $\varepsilon$. Splitting the bound into manageable pieces (triangular inequality, factoring) reveals how $\delta$ should depend on $\varepsilon$.

## Variants
- **Linear and polynomial functions:** Bounds come directly from factoring and known coefficients.
- **Quotients:** Ensure the denominator stays away from zero by simultaneously enforcing $|x-a|<1$ or similar constraints.
- **Composition with continuous functions:** Combine known $\delta$ choices via limit laws to avoid starting from scratch.

## Connections
- Complements computational shortcuts: even when limit laws predict the answer, an $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proof justifies it rigorously.
- Relies on inequality tools such as triangle inequality and bounding denominators away from zero.
- Often paired with the Squeeze Theorem when direct bounding is difficult.

## Errors
- Choosing $\delta$ that depends on $x$ after the start of the proof instead of a fixed value.
- Forgetting to state auxiliary bounds (like $|x-a|<1$) that control denominators or higher powers.
- Presenting $\delta$ implicitly rather than giving an explicit formula or minimum of candidate bounds.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What is the usual first step after fixing $\varepsilon>0$?  
   **Answer:** Manipulate $|f(x)-L|$ algebraically to express it in terms of $|x-a|$ and constants, guiding the choice of $\delta$.
2. **Question:** Why might a proof set $\delta = \min\{1, \varepsilon/5\}$?  
   **Answer:** The bound $1$ controls the size of $|x-a|$ for auxiliary estimates, while $\varepsilon/5$ ensures the final inequality $|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$.
3. **Question:** How can limit laws simplify an $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proof?  
   **Answer:** By allowing you to reuse proven limits for simpler components, reducing the proof to bounding each part separately.
