## Definition
A removable discontinuity occurs at $a$ when $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists and is finite, but $f(a)$ is either undefined or not equal to that limit. Setting $f(a)$ to the limit value yields a continuous extension.

## Intuition
Graphically, a removable discontinuity appears as a hole: the curve approaches the same height from both sides but does not include the point. Algebraically, it often arises from a canceled factor or simplifiable expression that leaves an excluded input.

## Variants
- **Algebraic holes:** Factor cancellations in rational functions create missing points despite stable nearby behavior.
- **Piecewise definitions:** A piece may omit the boundary value even though both sides approach the same number.
- **Continuous extensions:** Defining $g(a)=\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ produces a function $g$ continuous at $a$.

## Connections
- Detected using one-sided limits and limit laws; both sides must agree.
- Key step in many computation strategies: simplify expressions to remove the hole before evaluating the limit.
- Distinguishes repairable discontinuities from jumps or essential breaks that cannot be fixed locally.

## Errors
- Assuming any $0/0$ limit signals a removable discontinuity without verifying that the limit actually exists and is finite.
- Forgetting to check both sides separately; agreement is necessary for removability.
- Leaving the function value unchanged after simplification, so the discontinuity persists.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What condition makes a discontinuity removable?  
   **Answer:** A finite two-sided limit exists at the point but does not match the current function value.
2. **Question:** How do you fix $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ at $x=1$?  
   **Answer:** Define $f(1)=2$, matching the limit of the simplified form $x+1$.
3. **Question:** Why must both one-sided limits agree to call a discontinuity removable?  
   **Answer:** Without agreement there is no single value to assign that would make the function continuous at that point.
