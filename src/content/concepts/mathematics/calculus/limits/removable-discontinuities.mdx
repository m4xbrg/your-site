title: Removable Discontinuities
summary: >
  Discontinuities where the limit exists but the function value is either
  undefined or does not match the limit, allowing the discontinuity to be fixed

## Snapshot

A removable discontinuity occurs when the two‑sided limit exists at a point but
$f$ fails to take that value there (“hole” in the graph). Redefining $f(a)$
appropriately restores continuity.

## Formal Statement

$f$ has a **removable discontinuity at $a$** if:

1) The limit exists:
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L,
$$
2) but either $f(a)$ is undefined or
$$
f(a)\ne L.
$$
Redefine
$$
f(a)\coloneqq L
$$
to remove the discontinuity.

## Intuition & Interpretation

This is the mildest discontinuity: behavior is stable; only the definition at
the point is defective.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Cancellation**
$$
f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=x+1\quad (x\ne 1),
$$
limit at $1$ is $2$ though $f(1)$ is undefined.

2. **Mismatched value**
$$
g(x)=
\begin{cases}
x^2,& x\ne 2,\\
100,& x=2,
\end{cases}
$$
limit is $4$; redefining $g(2)=4$ removes the discontinuity.

3. **Single open circle** — Graphical hole with otherwise smooth behavior.

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump** — One‑sided limits disagree.  
2. **Infinite** — One or both sides diverge.  
3. **Oscillatory** — No single limit exists.

## Properties & Relationships

- Exactly the case “finite limit + mismatch/missing value”.  
- Only discontinuity type repaired by a single‑point change.  
- Often revealed by algebraic simplification.  
- Needed for interval continuity in piecewise definitions.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Mislabeling jump as removable.  
2. Forgetting to actually redefine $f(a)$.  
3. Assuming finite limit implies continuity.  
4. Overlooking domain restrictions that cause holes.

## Exercises

1. Classify the discontinuity of
$$
f(x)=\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}.
$$

2. **Repairing continuity** — For
$$
h(x)=
\begin{cases}
x+3,& x\ne -3,\\
0,& x=-3,
\end{cases}
$$
what $h(-3)$ makes $h$ continuous?

3. Conceptual — Why can’t an infinite limit be removable?

4. Mini‑proof — If $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$ and $f(a)=L$, the discontinuity at $a$ is removed.
