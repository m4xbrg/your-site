## Snapshot

A removable discontinuity occurs when the limit exists at a point but the
function fails to take that value at the point. Such discontinuities appear as
“holes” in a graph and can be fixed by defining the function appropriately at
the missing or mismatched point.

## Formal Statement

A function \( f \) has a **removable discontinuity at \( a \)** if:

1. The limit exists:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L,
   \]
2. but either:
   - \( f(a) \) is undefined, or  
   - \( f(a) \neq L \).

In both cases, redefining the function at the point:

\[
f(a) \coloneqq L
\]

restores continuity.

## Intuition & Interpretation

A removable discontinuity is the “mildest” type of discontinuity. The local
behavior of the function is stable and approaches a definite value, but the
actual function value at the point (or lack thereof) breaks continuity.

The cause is a defect in the *definition*, not in the function’s limiting
behavior.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Algebraic cancellation**
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = x+1 \quad (x\ne1).
   \]
   The limit at 1 is 2, but the function is undefined at 1 → removable.

2. **Defined incorrectly at the point**
   \[
   g(x)=
   \begin{cases}
   x^2,& x\ne 2,\\
   100,& x=2.
   \end{cases}
   \]
   The limit at 2 is 4, but \( g(2)=100 \).

3. **Piecewise hole**
   A graph with a single open circle but otherwise smooth around the point.

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump discontinuity**
   One-sided limits disagree; cannot be repaired by redefining a single value.

2. **Infinite discontinuity**
   One or both one-sided limits diverge → no finite limit to “fill.”

3. **Oscillatory essential discontinuity**
   No limit exists, so no single value can remove it.

## Properties & Relationships

- Removable discontinuities correspond exactly to finite limits with a mismatched or missing function value.
- They are the only discontinuities that can be repaired by modifying the function at exactly one point.
- Algebraic simplification often reveals removable discontinuities hidden in rational expressions.
- Continuity on intervals may require eliminating removable discontinuities.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Mistaking jump discontinuities for removable ones.  
2. Forgetting that a function must be *redefined* at the discontinuity to achieve continuity.  
3. Assuming a finite limit always means the function is continuous there.  
4. Overlooking domain restrictions that create holes (e.g., square roots or logarithms).

## Exercises

1. **Classification**
   Classify the discontinuity of:
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}.
   \]

2. **Repairing continuity**
   For the function:
   \[
   h(x)=\begin{cases}
   x+3,& x\ne -3,\\
   0,& x=-3,
   \end{cases}
   \]
   determine what value should replace \( h(-3) \) to make the function continuous.

3. **Conceptual**
   Explain why an infinite limit cannot produce a removable discontinuity.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**
   Prove that if \( \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L \) and \( f(a) = L \), then the
   discontinuity at \( a \) is removed.
