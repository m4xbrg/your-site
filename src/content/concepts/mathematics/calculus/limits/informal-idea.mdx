## Definition
A limit expresses that the outputs of a function get as close as desired to a number $L$ whenever the inputs are taken sufficiently close to a point $a$ (with $x \neq a$). The statement $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$ records that nearby behavior, not the exact value at $a$.

## Intuition
Think of walking toward $x=a$ without stepping exactly on it. If the function values you encounter settle near $L$, that number is the limit. The approach can happen even when $f(a)$ is undefined or different, because the limit cares only about the trend as you close in.

## Variants
- **Two-sided limits:** Approach $a$ from both left and right and demand the same target value.
- **One-sided limits:** Approach only from $x>a$ or $x<a$ when the function's behavior is directional.
- **No finite limit:** Oscillation or unbounded growth near $a$ prevents stabilization at a real number.

## Connections
- Serves as the foundation for formal $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definitions, limit laws, and continuity tests.
- If $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$ and $f(a) = L$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$; changing $f(a)$ alone does not alter the limit.
- One-sided limits combine to produce two-sided limits when they agree.

## Errors
- Confusing the limit with $f(a)$; the limit may exist even when $f(a)$ is undefined or different.
- Looking only at the value exactly at $a$ instead of the nearby trend.
- Assuming any smooth-looking graph has a limit; oscillation such as $\sin(1/x)$ near $0$ is a counterexample.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** Can $\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)$ exist if $f(2)$ is undefined?  
   **Answer:** Yes; the limit depends on values near $2$, not at $2$.
2. **Question:** What must be true of the left- and right-hand behaviors for a two-sided limit to exist?  
   **Answer:** They must both approach the same finite number $L$ as $x$ approaches the point.
3. **Question:** Does changing the single value $f(a)$ affect $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$?  
   **Answer:** No; altering $f(a)$ alone leaves the nearby trend—and thus the limit—unchanged.
