## Snapshot

A limit describes how a function behaves as the input gets arbitrarily close to a
point. The value the function approaches (if any) is the limit. This behavior is
independent of whether the function is defined at the point or whether it equals
the limit there.

## Formal Statement

Informally, saying

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
```
$$

means:

- When $ x $ is sufficiently close to $ a $ (but not equal to $ a $),
  the values of $ f(x) $ get arbitrarily close to $ L $.
- The function’s behavior at $ x = a $ does not determine the value of the limit.
- Only the approach toward $ a $ matters, not the value at $ a $.

This statement does *not* use the full epsilon–delta definition; instead, it
captures the behavioral idea that motivates the formal definition.

## Intuition & Interpretation

The limit focuses solely on the behavior of $ f(x) $ *near* the point $ a $.
Even if the function is undefined at $ a $, or takes an unrelated value there,
the limit can still exist.

Conceptually:

- The limit analyzes a **neighborhood** around $ a $, excluding the point itself.  
- What happens exactly at $ a $ is irrelevant.  
- The behavior of $ f(x) $ becomes “stable” as $ x $ approaches $ a $.

This view separates the notion of “approaching a value” from “equal to a value.”

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1.  
   $$
```tex
f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
```
$$
```tex
   simplifies to $ x+1 $ for $ x \neq 1 $. As $ x\to1 $,  
```
   $ f(x) \to 2 $ even though $ f(1) $ is undefined.

2.  
   $ f(x) = |x|/x $ for $ x \neq 0 $.  
```tex
   As $ x\to 0^+ $, $ f(x)=1 $.  
```
```tex
   As $ x\to 0^- $, $ f(x)=-1 $.  
```
   One-sided limits exist (different values), highlighting how limits describe
   behavior near the point.

3.  
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to 3} (x^2 + 1) = 10
```
$$
   is determined entirely by the values of the expression near 3; the actual
   evaluation at 3 plays no conceptual role for the limit.

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump discontinuity**  
   A function that abruptly changes values near $ a $ does not approach a single
   number, so the limit does not exist.

2. **Infinite oscillation**  
   $ f(x) = \sin(1/x) $ near $ 0 $ never stabilizes, so no limit exists.

3. **Infinite behavior**  
   $ f(x) = 1/x $ near $ 0 $ does not approach any finite real number.

These illustrate that limits require stable behavior near the point.

## Properties & Relationships

- Limits describe **local behavior**, not pointwise value.
- The definition sets the stage for:
  - one-sided limits,
  - continuity,
  - infinite limits,
  - the epsilon–delta definition.
- If the limit exists and the function is defined at the point and equals that
  limit, then the function is continuous there.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Believing the function must be defined at the point for the limit to exist.  
2. Confusing the limit value with the function value at the point.  
3. Assuming that approaching from both sides always gives the same value.  
4. Thinking that visual “closeness” is sufficient without stability of behavior.

## Exercises

1. **Conceptual**  
   Can a function have a limit at $ a $ if it is undefined at $ a $?
   Explain with a clear example.

2. **Conceptual**  
```tex
   Give an example of a function where $ \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L $ but  
```
   $ f(a) \neq L $. Explain the difference.

3. **Non-example analysis**  
```tex
   Explain why $ \lim_{x\to 0} \sin(1/x) $ does not exist.
```

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Explain why modifying the value of a function at a single point does not
   change any limit.
