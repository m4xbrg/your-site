## Snapshot

A limit describes how a function behaves as the input gets arbitrarily close to a
point. The value approached (if any) is the **limit**, independent of whether the
function is defined or equal to that value at the point.

## Formal Statement

Informally, saying
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
$$
means:

- For $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ (but $x\ne a$), $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $L$.  
- The function’s behavior at $x=a$ does not determine the limit.  
- Only the approach toward $a$ matters.

## Intuition & Interpretation

The limit focuses on behavior *near* $a$. Even if $f$ is undefined at $a$ or
takes a different value there, the limit can still exist.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1.
$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
$$
simplifies to $x+1$ for $x\ne 1$. As $x\to1$, $f(x)\to2$ even though $f(1)$ is undefined.

2. $f(x)=|x|/x$ for $x\ne 0$. As $x\to 0^+$, $f(x)=1$; as $x\to 0^-$, $f(x)=-1$.  
One‑sided limits highlight directional behavior.

3.
$$
\lim_{x\to3}(x^2+1)=10.
$$

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump discontinuity** — Abrupt change near $a$ prevents a single limit.  
2. **Infinite oscillation**
$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \sin(1/x) \ \text{does not exist.}
$$
3. **Infinite behavior** — $1/x$ near $0$ has no finite limit.

## Properties & Relationships

- Local behavior, not pointwise value.  
- Leads to: one‑sided limits, continuity, infinite limits, and the formal ($\varepsilon$–$\delta$) definition.  
- If $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$ and $f(a)=L$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$.

## Exercises

1. **Conceptual** — Can a function have a limit at $a$ if it is undefined at $a$? Give an example.  
2. **Conceptual** — Give an example with $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$ but $f(a)\ne L$.  
3. **Non‑example** — Why does $\lim_{x\to 0} \sin(1/x)$ fail to exist?  
4. **Mini‑proof** — Explain why changing $f(a)$ does not change any two‑sided limit at $a$.

## Math test

Inline: $x^2 + 1$.

$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$
