## Snapshot

Limit computation often reduces to transforming an expression into one where the
algebraic limit laws apply directly. Typical techniques include substitution,
factoring and canceling terms, rationalization using conjugates, and isolating
dominant terms. These methods resolve indeterminate forms and reveal the true
behavior of the function near the limit point.

## Formal Statement

There is no single theorem; instead, this concept groups a set of algebraic
procedures that are valid when:

1. The rewritten expression is **algebraically equivalent** to the original for
   all \( x \) in a punctured neighborhood of the limit point.
2. The rewritten form yields a limit that exists and is finite (or infinite,
   when analyzing asymptotic behavior).

The main strategies are:

1. **Direct substitution** when the expression is well-defined.  
2. **Factoring and canceling common factors** to resolve \(0/0\) forms.  
3. **Rationalizing numerator or denominator** using conjugates.  
4. **Common denominators** for sums of rational expressions.  
5. **Dominant-term comparison** for polynomial and rational functions.  
6. **Algebraic isolation** (adding/subtracting the same term, multiplying by 1).  

## Intuition & Interpretation

Limit computation is fundamentally about revealing the structure of a function
near a point. Indeterminate forms obscure that structure by hiding critical
cancellations or symmetries. Algebraic simplifications make the underlying
behavior explicit so that limit laws can be applied reliably.

The key idea is to replace the original expression by an equivalent one that is
simpler *in a neighborhood of the point*, not necessarily at the point itself.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Factoring to resolve 0/0**  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}
   = \lim_{x\to 2} \frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{x-2}
   = \lim_{x\to 2} (x+1) = 3.
   \]

2. **Rationalizing a numerator**  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sqrt{x+1} - 1}{x}
   = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x}{x(\sqrt{x+1}+1)}
   = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

3. **Dominant-term for rational functions**  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 1}{6x^2 + 5}
   = \frac{3}{6} = \frac12.
   \]

4. **Direct substitution** (no simplification needed)  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 1} (3x^2 + 2) = 5.
   \]

### Non-Examples (Incorrect Uses)

1. **Canceling when factorization is not valid**  
   \[
   \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = x + 1
   \]
   is valid only for \( x \neq 1 \). Direct substitution on the original form
   fails.

2. **Using dominant-term rules when degrees mismatch subtly**  
   E.g.,  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2 - x^3}
   \]
   cannot use equal-degree comparison; denominator grows faster and changes sign.

3. **Rationalizing incorrectly**  
   Multiplying numerator and denominator by different conjugates introduces
   non-equivalent expressions.

4. **Assuming simplification changes function value at the limit point**  
   Equivalent expressions need not match at the point — only in a neighborhood.

## Properties & Relationships

- Many simplifications convert an indeterminate form into one where limit laws
  apply directly.
- Techniques often reveal **removable discontinuities**, establishing
  connections with the concept of continuity.
- Dominant-term methods are structurally related to **limits at infinity**.
- Algebraic simplification is often a prerequisite for using the **squeeze
  theorem**.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Treating algebraic equivalence at a point as necessary; equivalence is needed
   only in a punctured neighborhood.  
2. Forgetting that simplification may hide domain restrictions that affect limit
   interpretation.  
3. Misidentifying \(0/0\) forms and applying techniques where limits actually
   diverge.  
4. Using dominant-term comparison in expressions where signs or lower-degree
   terms control behavior near the point.

## Exercises

1. **Compute**  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 3} \frac{x^2 - 9}{x-3}.
   \]

2. **Rationalization**  
   Evaluate  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 4} \frac{\sqrt{x} - 2}{x-4}.
   \]

3. **Dominant terms**  
   Compute  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5x^3 - x}{10x^3 + 7}.
   \]

4. **Conceptual**  
   Explain why factorization cannot help evaluate  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{x}.
   \]

5. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Explain why replacing a function with an algebraically equivalent expression
   in a punctured neighborhood preserves its limit.
