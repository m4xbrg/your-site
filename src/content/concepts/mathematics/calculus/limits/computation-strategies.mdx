## Definition
Computing a limit involves choosing transformations that preserve the limit while simplifying the expression. Standard steps include direct substitution when the function is continuous at the point, algebraic manipulation to remove removable discontinuities, application of limit laws, and comparison to known benchmark limits.

## Intuition
The goal is to reveal stable nearby behavior. If substitution works, the function was continuous there. If substitution yields $0/0$ or another indeterminate form, algebraic rewrites can expose cancellation or dominant terms. When algebra stalls, comparison or squeezing pinpoints the limiting value.

## Variants
- **Direct substitution:** Works for polynomials, rational functions with nonzero denominators, and continuous combinations.
- **Algebraic cleanup:** Factorization, rationalization, and common denominators remove holes or expose cancellations.
- **Standard limits:** Use benchmarks like $\lim_{x\to0} \dfrac{\sin x}{x}=1$ or $\lim_{x\to\infty}(1+1/x)^x = e$ as building blocks.
- **Squeeze or comparison:** Trap an unknown limit between simpler expressions to force convergence.

## Connections
- Relies on limit laws to justify algebraic steps.
- Partners with the Squeeze Theorem for oscillatory or bounded expressions.
- Highlights removable discontinuities: successful cancellation shows a hidden continuous extension.

## Errors
- Applying substitution when the denominator tends to $0$ without checking for cancellation.
- Using algebraic manipulations that change the domain near the limit point (e.g., multiplying by non-equivalent expressions).
- Ignoring dominant terms for limits at infinity, leading to incorrect growth estimates.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What is the first check when evaluating $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$?  
   **Answer:** Try direct substitution; if it gives a finite value, the limit equals $f(a)$.
2. **Question:** Which technique resolves a $0/0$ form in $\lim_{x\to 1} \dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$?  
   **Answer:** Factorization and cancellation yield $\lim_{x\to1} (x+1)=2$.
3. **Question:** When is the Squeeze Theorem preferred over algebraic manipulation?  
   **Answer:** When the expression is bounded between two functions with known limits but resists direct simplification, such as $x\sin(1/x)$ near $0$.
