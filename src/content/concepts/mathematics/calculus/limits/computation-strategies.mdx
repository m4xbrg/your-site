## Snapshot

Limit computation often reduces to transforming an expression into one where the
algebraic limit laws apply directly. Typical techniques include substitution,
factoring and canceling terms, rationalization using conjugates, and isolating
dominant terms. These methods resolve indeterminate forms and reveal the true
behavior of the function near the limit point.

## Formal Statement

There is no single theorem; instead, this concept groups a set of algebraic
procedures that are valid when:

1. The rewritten expression is **algebraically equivalent** to the original for
   all $x$ in a punctured neighborhood of the limit point.
2. The rewritten form yields a limit that exists and is finite (or infinite,
   when analyzing asymptotic behavior).

The main strategies are:

1. **Direct substitution** when the expression is well-defined.  
2. **Factoring and canceling common factors** to resolve $0/0$ forms.  
3. **Rationalizing numerator or denominator** using conjugates.  
4. **Common denominators** for sums of rational expressions.  
5. **Dominant-term comparison** for polynomial and rational functions.  
6. **Algebraic isolation** (adding/subtracting the same term, multiplying by 1).  

## Intuition & Interpretation

Limit computation is fundamentally about revealing the structure of a function
near a point. Indeterminate forms obscure that structure by hiding critical
cancellations or symmetries. Algebraic simplifications make the underlying
behavior explicit so that limit laws can be applied reliably.

The key idea is to replace the original expression by an equivalent one that is
simpler *in a neighborhood of the point*, not necessarily at the point itself.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Factoring to resolve $0/0$**
$$
\lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}
= \lim_{x\to 2} \frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}
= \lim_{x\to 2} (x+2)
= 4.
$$

2. **Rationalizing a numerator** (multiply by the conjugate)
$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sqrt{x+1} - 1}{x}
= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{(\sqrt{x+1}-1)(\sqrt{x+1}+1)}{x(\sqrt{x+1}+1)}
= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x}{x(\sqrt{x+1}+1)}
= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+1}+1}
= \frac{1}{2}.
$$

3. **Dominant-term for rational functions**
$$
\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 1}{6x^2 + 5}
= \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

4. **Direct substitution** (no simplification needed)
$$
\lim_{x\to 1} (3x^2 + 2) = 5.
$$

### Non-Examples (Incorrect Uses)

1. **Canceling when factorization is not valid**  
$$
\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = x + 1 \quad \text{only for } x\neq 1.
$$
Direct substitution on the **unsimplified** form still fails at $x=1$.

2. **Using dominant-term rules when degrees mismatch subtly**  
For
$$
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2 - x^3},
$$
the denominator grows faster with sign changes; equal-degree comparison does not apply.

3. **Rationalizing incorrectly**  
Multiplying numerator and denominator by *different* conjugates introduces a non‑equivalent expression.

4. **Assuming simplification must match value at the point**  
Equivalence is required on a **punctured neighborhood**; the value at the point may differ.

## Properties & Relationships

- Simplification often converts an indeterminate form to one where limit laws apply.
- Reveals **removable discontinuities**, connecting to continuity.
- Dominant-term methods relate to **limits at infinity**.
- Algebraic simplification is often a precursor to using the **squeeze theorem**.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Demanding equivalence at the point (unnecessary).  
2. Hiding domain restrictions after canceling.  
3. Misidentifying $0/0$ vs divergence.  
4. Applying dominant-term rules when lower-degree terms control behavior locally.

## Exercises

1. **Compute**
$$
\lim_{x\to 3} \frac{x^2 - 9}{x-3}.
$$

2. **Rationalization** — Evaluate
$$
\lim_{x\to 4} \frac{\sqrt{x} - 2}{x-4}.
$$

3. **Dominant terms** — Compute
$$
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{5x^3 - x}{10x^3 + 7}.
$$

4. **Conceptual** — Why can’t factorization help with
$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{x}\,?
$$

5. **Mini-proof (Sketch)** — Explain why algebraic equivalence on a punctured
neighborhood preserves the limit.
