## Definition
The expression
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
$$
means that the values of $f(x)$ become arbitrarily close to $L$ whenever $x$ is sufficiently close to $a$ (with $x\ne a$). One-sided limits use arrows with $a^+$ or $a^-$, such as $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$, to restrict the direction of approach.

## Intuition
Limit notation packages the idea of stability near a point. The arrow emphasizes movement toward $a$, while the value on the right of the equality marks the target that $f(x)$ settles near. One-sided symbols isolate the behavior from a single direction when left and right behaviors differ.

## Variants
- **Two-sided limit:** $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ requires agreement from both sides.
- **Right-hand limit:** $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ follows inputs greater than $a$.
- **Left-hand limit:** $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ follows inputs less than $a$.
- **Infinite limit notation:** $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \infty$ records unbounded growth near $a$.

## Connections
- Two-sided limits exist precisely when left- and right-hand limits agree and are finite.
- The $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definition formalizes the meaning of $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$.
- Precise notation underlies limit laws, continuity criteria, and statements about asymptotic behavior.

## Errors
- Writing $f(a)$ instead of $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ when describing nearby trends.
- Omitting the direction indicator $a^\pm$ when left and right behaviors differ.
- Using equal signs between expressions that have different limiting processes, such as replacing $x\to a^+$ with $x\to a$ without justification.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What does $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$ assert about $f(a)$?  
   **Answer:** Nothing; it only describes values near $a$, so $f(a)$ may differ or be undefined.
2. **Question:** When do we write $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ instead of $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$?  
   **Answer:** When we care only about the behavior as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left.
3. **Question:** How is unbounded growth near $a$ written in limit notation?  
   **Answer:** With $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \infty$ (or $-\infty$) to show divergence rather than a finite target.
