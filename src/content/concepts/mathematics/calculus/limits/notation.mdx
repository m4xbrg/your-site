## Snapshot

Limit notation expresses the idea that values of a function stabilize near a
number as inputs approach a point. The expression
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
```
encodes approach, stability, and independence from $f(a)$.

## Formal Statement

Read
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
```
as: “The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$.”

Components:

- **Variable** $x$ (input) approaching  
- **Point** $a$  
- **Function** $f(x)$  
- **Limit value** $L$

Vocabulary:

- “$x$ approaches $a$” → $x$ can be made arbitrarily close to $a$ (not equal).  
- A **neighborhood** of $a$ → values near $a$.  
- “$f(x)$ tends to $L$” → $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$.

No claim is made about $f(a)$.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Emphasis:

- **near** the point (not at the point),  
- **closeness** (not equality),  
- **consistent approach** (not fluctuation).

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1.
```tex
\lim_{x\to 2} (x^2 + 1) = 5.
```

2. Even if
```tex
f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
```
is undefined at $x=1$,
```tex
\lim_{x\to 1} f(x) = 2.
```

3. If both sides approach 7, then
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = 7.
```

### Non-Examples

1. $f(a)=L$ is **not** the same as
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L.
```

2. If one‑sided behaviors disagree, the two‑sided limit does not exist.

3. Informal arrows like $f(x)\to L$ for $x\approx a$ are not standard.

## Properties & Relationships

- Used in continuity, laws, and definitions.  
- **One‑sided notation:**
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x), \qquad \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x).
```
- Infinite limits replace $L$ with $\pm\infty$.  
- Derivatives use a limit.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Treating $\lim f = f(a)$ by default.  
2. Ignoring two‑sided agreement.  
3. Misreading one‑sided subscripts.  
4. Equating “approaches” with “equals.”

## Exercises

1. Interpret
```tex
\lim_{x\to 3} f(x) = 10.
```

2. Convert “As $x$ approaches 0, $f(x)$ approaches 4” into notation.

3. Express “the right‑hand limit at 5 equals 2.”

4. Mini‑proof — Why is $f(a)$ irrelevant to interpreting $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$?
