## Snapshot

Limit notation expresses the idea that the values of a function become close to a
specific number as the input becomes close to a particular point. The notation
$ \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L $ concisely encodes the entire concept of approaching,
stability of behavior, and independence from the function’s value at the point.

## Formal Statement

The expression

```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
```

is read as:

> “The limit of $ f(x) $ as $ x $ approaches $ a $ is $ L $.”

The components are:

- **Variable:** $ x $, the input approaching a point.
- **Approach point:** $ a $, the value toward which $ x $ moves.
- **Function:** $ f(x) $, the expression being evaluated.
- **Limit value:** $ L $, the value approached by $ f(x) $.

Standard vocabulary:

- “$ x $ approaches $ a $” means $ x $ is taken arbitrarily close to $ a $,
  but not equal to it.
- A **neighborhood** of $ a $ refers to a range of values near $ a $.
- Saying “$ f(x) $ tends to $ L $” indicates $ f(x) $ becomes arbitrarily
  close to $ L $ within small enough neighborhoods of $ a $.

This notation does not claim anything about $ f(a) $. The function may equal
$ L $, differ from $ L $, or be undefined at $ a $.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Limit notation captures a stable pattern in the values of a function. The
emphasis is on:

- **behavior near the point**, not at the point;
- **closeness of values**, not equality;
- **consistent approach**, not arbitrary fluctuation.

The notation cleanly separates the *target value* $ L $ from the *approach
point* $ a $, making limits the foundation for continuity and derivatives.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1.  
```tex
\lim_{x\to 2} (x^2 + 1) = 5
```
   since substituting values of $ x $ near 2 produces values near 5.

2.  
   For  
```tex
f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
```
   even though $ f(1) $ is undefined,  
```tex
\lim_{x\to 1} f(x) = 2.
```

3.  
   If left-hand and right-hand behavior both approach 7,  
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = 7.
```

### Non-Examples

1.  
   Writing  
   $$
f(a) = L
$$
   is not equivalent to  
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L.
```

2.  
   If left-hand and right-hand behaviors disagree,  
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x)
```
   does not exist, even though notation may be misapplied.

3.  
   Expressions such as  
```tex
f(x) \to L \quad (x \approx a)
```
   are informal but not standard notation.

## Properties & Relationships

- Limit notation is used in the definition of continuity.
- It enables the statement of algebraic limit laws concisely.
- One-sided limits use modified notation:
```tex
- $ \lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) $
- $ \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) $
```

- Infinite limits replace the limit value with $ +\infty $ or $ -\infty $.

- The derivative is defined using a limit expression.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Treating the limit equal to the function value by default.  
2. Assuming the notation applies without checking two-sided agreement.  
3. Misreading subscripts or superscripts in one-sided notation.  
4. Thinking “approaches” means “equals.”

## Exercises

1. **Interpretation**  
   Explain the meaning of  
```tex
\lim_{x\to 3} f(x) = 10.
```

2. **Symbolic ↔ verbal**  
   Convert the verbal statement  
   “As $ x $ approaches 0, $ f(x) $ approaches 4”  
   into correct limit notation.

3. **One-sided notation**  
   Express “the right-hand limit of $ f(x) $ at 5 equals 2” using standard
   notation.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Explain why the value of $ f(a) $ is irrelevant when interpreting limit notation.
