## Snapshot

Continuity on an interval requires continuity at every point within the interval.
For open intervals, only two-sided limits matter. For closed intervals, continuity
at endpoints requires checking one-sided limits. This concept provides the
foundation for major theorems such as the Intermediate Value Theorem.

## Formal Statement

A function \( f \) is **continuous on an open interval** \( (a,b) \) if:

\[
f \text{ is continuous at every point } c \in (a,b).
\]

A function is **continuous on a closed interval** \([a,b]\) if:

1. \( f \) is continuous at every interior point \( c \in (a,b) \),
2. the right-hand limit at the left endpoint exists and equals the function value:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a),
   \]
3. the left-hand limit at the right endpoint exists and equals the function value:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to b^-} f(x) = f(b).
   \]

Half-open intervals require checking the appropriate endpoint condition.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity on an interval means the function has no breaks, holes, jumps, or
asymptotes throughout that region. The function’s behavior aligns with its local
limit behavior everywhere within the interval.

For closed intervals, endpoints are treated with one-sided reasoning because
the function’s domain restricts possible approaches.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Polynomial continuity**
   Every polynomial is continuous on any interval (open or closed).

2. **Piecewise continuous**
   A function defined piecewise but continuous at joining points is continuous on
   the full interval.

3. **Closed interval endpoint check**
   For  
   \[
   f(x)=\sqrt{x}
   \]
   on \([0,4]\), the left endpoint condition is:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to0^+} \sqrt{x} = 0 = f(0).
   \]

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump inside interval**
   A function with a jump at \( c\in(a,b) \) is not continuous on that interval.

2. **Infinite discontinuity at interior point**
   Vertical asymptotes break continuity on any interval containing the point.

3. **Endpoint mismatch**
   If  
   \[
   \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) \neq f(a),
   \]
   then the function is not continuous on \([a,b]\).

## Properties & Relationships

- Continuity on an interval is stronger than continuity at individual points.
- The Intermediate Value Theorem requires continuity on a closed interval.
- Algebraic combinations of continuous functions (sum, product, composition)
  remain continuous on any shared interval of definition.
- Piecewise functions are continuous on intervals if each piece is continuous and
  the joining points satisfy continuity conditions.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting to check one-sided limits at endpoints of closed intervals.  
2. Confusing continuity on an interval with differentiability (stronger).  
3. Assuming continuity of a piecewise function without checking transition points.  
4. Ignoring domain restrictions when analyzing endpoint behavior.

## Exercises

1. **Endpoint check**
   Let  
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}
   \]
   on \([-2,2]\). Verify continuity at both endpoints.

2. **Piecewise analysis**
   Determine whether the function  
   \[
   f(x)=\begin{cases}
   x+1,& x<1,\\
   x^2,& x\ge1
   \end{cases}
   \]
   is continuous on \([0,3]\).

3. **Conceptual**
   Explain why one-sided limits are necessary for discussing continuity on closed
   intervals but not on open intervals.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**
   Prove that if \( f \) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and \( g \) is continuous at 
   every value \( f(x) \) takes on \([a,b]\), then the composition \( g\circ f \) 
   is continuous on \([a,b]\).
