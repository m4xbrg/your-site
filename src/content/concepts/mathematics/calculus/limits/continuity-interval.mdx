## Definition
A function $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ if it is continuous at every interior point of $I$ and continuous from the right at a left endpoint or from the left at a right endpoint. For open intervals, only interior continuity is required.

## Intuition
Continuity on an interval means the graph can be drawn over that entire stretch without lifting the pencil. Endpoints are handled by one-sided limits because only one direction of approach is available there.

## Variants
- **Closed interval $[a,b]$:** Continuous on $(a,b)$, continuous from the right at $a$, and from the left at $b$.
- **Half-open intervals:** Require continuity from the available side at the included endpoint.
- **Piecewise intervals:** Check continuity on each piece and at boundary points between pieces.

## Connections
- Guarantees the Intermediate Value Theorem and Extreme Value Theorem for closed bounded intervals when $f$ is continuous on them.
- Builds on pointwise continuity and one-sided limits at endpoints.
- Interval continuity is a prerequisite for discussing differentiability and integrability on that domain.

## Errors
- Ignoring endpoint behavior when declaring continuity on closed or half-open intervals.
- Assuming continuity on an interval from continuity at isolated points without checking the entire domain.
- Forgetting to verify continuity at internal junctions of piecewise definitions.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** What additional condition is needed at the left endpoint of $[a,b]$ for continuity on the interval?  
   **Answer:** $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ must exist and equal $f(a)$.
2. **Question:** Is continuity on $(a,b)$ alone enough to claim continuity on $[a,b]$?  
   **Answer:** No; you must also check one-sided continuity at $a$ and $b$.
3. **Question:** How does interval continuity relate to the Intermediate Value Theorem?  
   **Answer:** The theorem requires continuity on the interval to ensure the function takes every intermediate value between two outputs.
