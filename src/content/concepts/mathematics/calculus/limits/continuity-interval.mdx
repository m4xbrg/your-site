## Snapshot

Continuity on an interval requires continuity at every point within the interval.
For open intervals, only two-sided limits matter. For closed intervals, continuity
at endpoints requires checking one-sided limits. This concept provides the
foundation for the Intermediate Value Theorem.

## Formal Statement

- **Open interval $(a,b)$:** $f$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ if it is continuous at every $c\in(a,b)$.

- **Closed interval $[a,b]$:** $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ if  
  1) $f$ is continuous at every interior point $c\in(a,b)$, and  
  2) the right-hand endpoint condition holds:
  ```tex
  \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a),
  ```
  3) the left-hand endpoint condition holds:
  ```tex
  \lim_{x\to b^-} f(x) = f(b).
  ```

- **Half-open intervals** require checking the appropriate one-sided endpoint.

## Intuition & Interpretation

Continuity on an interval means the function has no breaks, holes, jumps, or
asymptotes throughout that region. Endpoints on closed/half‑open intervals are
handled with one‑sided limits due to domain restrictions.

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Polynomial continuity** — Polynomials are continuous on any interval.

2. **Piecewise, but continuous at joins** — If pieces match at boundaries, the whole interval is continuous.

3. **Closed interval endpoint check**  
For $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ on $[0,4]$:
```tex
\lim_{x\to0^+} \sqrt{x} = 0 = f(0).
```

### Non-Examples

1. **Jump inside interval** — A jump at some $c\in(a,b)$ breaks continuity.

2. **Infinite discontinuity at an interior point** — Vertical asymptotes break continuity.

3. **Endpoint mismatch** — If
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) \ne f(a),
```
then $f$ is not continuous on $[a,b]$.

## Properties & Relationships

- Continuity on an interval is stronger than continuity at a single point.
- The Intermediate Value Theorem requires continuity on a **closed** interval.
- Algebraic combinations and compositions of continuous functions remain continuous on shared intervals.
- For piecewise definitions, check both the pieces and the join points.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting one‑sided checks at endpoints of closed intervals.  
2. Confusing continuity with differentiability (stronger).  
3. Assuming piecewise functions are continuous without checking joins.  
4. Ignoring domains at endpoints.

## Exercises

1. **Endpoint check**  
Let $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{1+x^2}$ on $[-2,2]$. Verify continuity at both endpoints.

2. **Piecewise analysis** — Determine whether
```tex
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
x+1,& x<1,\\
x^2,& x\ge 1
\end{cases}
```
is continuous on $[0,3]$.

3. **Conceptual** — Explain why one-sided limits are necessary at closed-interval endpoints.

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)** — If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $g$ is continuous on the range of $f$ over $[a,b]$, show $g\circ f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
