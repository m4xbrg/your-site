## Definition
The right-hand limit $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ is $L$ if $f(x)$ approaches $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ through values greater than $a$. The left-hand limit $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ is defined analogously using values less than $a$. A two-sided limit exists and equals $L$ exactly when both one-sided limits equal $L$.

## Intuition
Restricting approach to one side isolates directional behavior. Functions with jumps, endpoints, or domain restrictions may stabilize from one side while behaving differently—or being undefined—on the other.

## Variants
- **Endpoint limits:** Only one one-sided limit is meaningful at domain endpoints.
- **Piecewise functions:** Each piece may control one side of $a$, requiring separate evaluation.
- **Infinite one-sided limits:** One side may blow up to $\pm\infty$ while the other remains finite.

## Connections
- Determines continuity at a point: continuity requires both one-sided limits to exist, match each other, and equal the function value.
- Supports classification of discontinuities by comparing left and right behavior.
- Essential for absolute value, step functions, and limits on intervals with boundaries.

## Errors
- Assuming a two-sided limit exists because one one-sided limit does.
- Ignoring domain restrictions that remove one side of approach.
- Treating $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ as interchangeable without checking equality.

## Micro-checks
1. **Question:** When does $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ equal a number $L$ based on one-sided limits?  
   **Answer:** Exactly when $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = L$.
2. **Question:** Can a right-hand limit exist at a left endpoint of the domain?  
   **Answer:** Yes; the right-hand limit describes the behavior as inputs move inward from the domain side that exists.
3. **Question:** What does it mean if $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ is finite but $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ is $\infty$?  
   **Answer:** The two-sided limit does not exist because the directional behaviors differ.
