## Snapshot

One-sided limits capture the behavior of a function as \( x \) approaches a point
from only one direction. A two-sided limit exists exactly when both one-sided
limits exist and are equal. This makes one-sided limits fundamental for
classifying discontinuities and analyzing asymptotic behavior.

## Formal Statement

The **right-hand limit** of \( f(x) \) at \( a \) is written:

\[
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = L
\]

meaning that \( f(x) \) becomes arbitrarily close to \( L \) as \( x \) approaches
\( a \) *using only values greater than \( a \)*.

The **left-hand limit** of \( f(x) \) at \( a \) is written:

\[
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = L
\]

meaning that \( f(x) \) becomes arbitrarily close to \( L \) as \( x \) approaches
\( a \) *using only values less than \( a \)*.

The two-sided limit exists iff both one-sided limits exist and are equal:

\[
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = L
\text{ and }
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = L.
\]

## Intuition & Interpretation

Points of discontinuity often reveal different behavior from the left and right.
One-sided limits isolate that behavior. They allow:

- precise statements about jumps or asymptotes,  
- analysis on domains that are naturally one-sided (e.g., \( \sqrt{x} \) near 0),  
- valid application of limit laws on restricted neighborhoods.

The idea is simply: **approach the point using inputs from only one direction.**

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Piecewise jump**

\[
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
1,& x<0,\\
3,& x>0.
\end{cases}
\]

Then  
\[
\lim_{x\to0^-} f(x)=1,\quad
\lim_{x\to0^+} f(x)=3.
\]
No two-sided limit.

2. **Continuous case**

For \( f(x)=x^2 \),  
\[
\lim_{x\to2^-} x^2 = \lim_{x\to2^+} x^2 = 4.
\]

3. **Domain restriction**

\[
f(x) = \sqrt{x}
\]
is defined only for \( x \ge 0 \).  
Thus one-sided limit:

\[
\lim_{x\to0^+} \sqrt{x} = 0,
\]
while the left-hand limit does not exist (domain is empty on the left).

4. **Infinite one-sided limit**

\[
\lim_{x\to 1^-} \frac{1}{x-1} = -\infty,\quad
\lim_{x\to 1^+} \frac{1}{x-1} = +\infty.
\]

### Non-Examples

1. Claiming a two-sided limit exists when one-sided limits disagree.  
2. Using values at \( x=a \) to determine one-sided limits.  
3. Assuming a function must be defined on both sides for a two-sided limit.

## Properties & Relationships

- One-sided limits determine the existence of a full limit.
- Jump discontinuities are characterized by unequal one-sided limits.
- Vertical asymptotes often require analyzing each side separately.
- Continuity at a point \( a \) requires:
  \[
  \lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
  \]
- Many real-world domains (time, distance, probability) enforce one-sided analysis.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that one-sided limits ignore the function value at the point.  
2. Confusing “does not exist” with “equals \( \pm\infty \)”—these are different.  
3. Assuming the left-hand limit exists even when the domain does not extend left.  
4. Misreading notation: “\( a^- \)” refers to a directional approach, not a value.

## Exercises

1. **Compute one-sided limits**
   For  
   \[
   f(x)=
   \begin{cases}
   x+2,& x<1,\\
   4,& x>1,
   \end{cases}
   \]
   compute \( \lim_{x\to1^-} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{x\to1^+} f(x) \).

2. **Domain analysis**  
   Explain why \( \lim_{x\to0^-} \sqrt{x} \) does not exist.

3. **Jump discontinuity detection**  
   Describe the one-sided limits for  
   \[
   f(x) = \begin{cases}
   5, & x<2,\\
   -1,& x\ge 2.
   \end{cases}
   \]

4. **Mini-proof (Sketch)**  
   Explain why a two-sided limit cannot exist unless both one-sided limits exist and are equal.
