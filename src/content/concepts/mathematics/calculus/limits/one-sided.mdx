## Snapshot

One‑sided limits analyze approach from a **single direction**. A two‑sided limit
exists iff both one‑sided limits exist and are equal.

## Formal Statement

Right‑hand:
$$
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = L
$$
Left‑hand:
$$
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = L
$$
Two‑sided:
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L \iff \big(\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = L \ \text{and}\ \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = L\big).
$$

## Intuition & Interpretation

One‑sided limits isolate directional behavior. They handle jumps, asymptotes,
and domains that only exist on one side (e.g., $\sqrt{x}$ near $0$).

## Examples & Non-Examples

### Examples

1. **Jump**
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
1,& x<0,\\
3,& x>0,
\end{cases}
\quad
\lim_{x\to0^-} f(x)=1,\ \lim_{x\to0^+} f(x)=3.
$$

2. **Continuous**
$$
\lim_{x\to2^-} x^2 = \lim_{x\to2^+} x^2 = 4.
$$

3. **Domain restriction**
$$
\lim_{x\to0^+} \sqrt{x} = 0,
$$
left‑hand limit does not exist (domain empty on the left).

4. **Infinite one‑sided limit**
$$
\lim_{x\to 1^-} \frac{1}{x-1} = -\infty,\qquad
\lim_{x\to 1^+} \frac{1}{x-1} = +\infty.
$$

### Non-Examples

1. Claiming a two‑sided limit when one‑sided limits disagree.  
2. Using $f(a)$ to determine one‑sided limits.  
3. Assuming both sides exist when the domain is one‑sided.

## Properties & Relationships

- Two‑sided limit exists iff both one‑sided limits exist & are equal.  
- Jump discontinuities are unequal one‑sided limits.  
- Continuity requires matching one‑sided limits and value:
$$
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
$$

## Common Pitfalls

1. Treating $f(a)$ as relevant to one‑sided limits.  
2. Confusing “DNE” with “$\pm\infty$”.  
3. Assuming left‑hand limit exists when domain does not extend left.  
4. Misreading notation ($a^-$/$a^+$).

## Exercises

1. Compute one‑sided limits for
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
x+2,& x<1,\\
4,& x>1.
\end{cases}
$$

2. Domain analysis — Explain why $\lim_{x\to0^-}\sqrt{x}$ does not exist.

3. Jump detection — For
$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
5, & x<2,\\
-1,& x\ge 2,
\end{cases}
$$
describe the one‑sided limits at $x=2$.

4. **Mini‑proof** — Why can’t a two‑sided limit exist unless both one‑sided limits exist and are equal?
