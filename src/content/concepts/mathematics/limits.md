A limit captures the value a function tends toward as its input approaches some number. Key ideas include:

- Evaluating limits algebraically with substitution, factoring, or rationalizing.
- Spotting when one-sided limits differ, signalling a jump discontinuity.
- Using the formal \(\varepsilon\)–\(\delta\) definition to reason about continuity.

These tools form the launch pad for derivatives, where you study how quickly functions change.
