A data structure pairs data with operations that keep it organized. Foundational structures include:

- **Arrays and lists** for ordered collections with positional access.
- **Stacks and queues** that enforce LIFO or FIFO processing.
- **Maps/dictionaries** that connect keys to values for quick lookup.

Learning their trade-offs prepares you to choose the right structure for a problem and reason about performance.
