Control flow statements let programs react to data and repeat work. The core tools include:

- **Conditionals** such as `if`, `else if`, and `else` blocks that choose a branch based on a boolean expression.
- **Loops** like `for` and `while` that repeat a block until a condition fails.
- **Early exits** (`break`, `continue`, and `return`) that jump out of the normal execution path when needed.

Understanding how to structure conditions and loops gives you the mental model for translating algorithms into code.
