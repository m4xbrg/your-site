Calculus describes change. In **Foundations of Calculus**, you'll explore how limits help us tame functions, how
instantaneous rates of change appear through derivatives, and how integrals accumulate quantities over intervals.

Each module mixes geometric insight with problem-solving strategies so you can connect theory to applications in
science and engineering. Completing the course equips you with the mental models needed for further study in analysis,
physics, and beyond.
