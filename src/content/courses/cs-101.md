Welcome to **Programming Basics**! This course introduces the core ideas behind writing software. You'll start by
understanding how programming languages represent data and how to choose the right types for the job. From there, you
will practise guiding your programs with conditional logic and loops before closing with a tour of the most common data
structures used in everyday development.

By the end, you'll be able to read and write simple programs, reason about how data moves through them, and feel ready to
dive into more advanced topics.
