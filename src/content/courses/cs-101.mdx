Welcome to CS-101! This course focuses on the core ideas that unlock most
introductory programming exercises. Each module blends a short explanation with
hands-on practice so you can internalize the flow of data through your code.

By the end of the course you should be able to read, write, and debug short
scripts, and feel confident exploring a new language's syntax on your own.
