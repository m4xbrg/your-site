This course introduces intuitive and formal notions of limits, continuity of functions, and how functions behave near a point or at infinity. It assumes comfort with algebraic manipulation, function notation, and basic trigonometry so learners can focus on new limit ideas rather than symbolic basics.

Across six lessons, students move from informal evidence for limits (Lesson 01) to algebraic limit laws and computation tools (Lesson 02), asymptotic behaviors such as one-sided and infinite limits (Lesson 03), and a formal treatment of continuity and discontinuities (Lesson 04). They then adopt the ε–δ definition (Lesson 05) and apply it in proofs alongside the Squeeze and Intermediate Value Theorems (Lesson 06). A concluding review consolidates the arc with targeted practice, mixed-format checks, and connections to derivative definitions.
