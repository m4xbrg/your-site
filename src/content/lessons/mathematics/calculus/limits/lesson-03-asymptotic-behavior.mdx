# Lesson Objectives
- **math-calculus-limits-one-sided:** Distinguish left-hand, right-hand, and two-sided limits.
- **math-calculus-limits-infinite-limits:** Interpret vertical asymptotes as divergence to $\pm\infty$.
- **math-calculus-limits-at-infinity:** Determine long-run behavior and horizontal asymptotes using dominant terms.

## Setup
- Keep the limit laws from Lesson 2 available for simplifying expressions.
- Sketch axes or use graphing software to visualize directional behavior.
- Recall that one-sided limits control whether a two-sided limit exists.

## Concept recap
### math-calculus-limits-one-sided — Directional approach
Two-sided limits exist only when left and right limits agree; mismatches signal jumps or other discontinuities.

### math-calculus-limits-infinite-limits — Vertical asymptotes
When $f(x)$ grows without bound near $a$, the notation $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=\pm\infty$ records both divergence and direction.

### math-calculus-limits-at-infinity — End behavior
For large $|x|$, dominant terms govern the value of rational and polynomial functions, revealing horizontal asymptotes or unbounded growth.

## Worked examples
- **One-sided mismatch (one-sided):** $\lim_{x\to0^-} \dfrac{|x|}{x}=-1$ and $\lim_{x\to0^+} \dfrac{|x|}{x}=1$, so the two-sided limit fails to exist.
- **Vertical asymptote (infinite-limits):** $\lim_{x\to3} \dfrac{1}{x-3}$ diverges to $-\infty$ from the left and $+\infty$ from the right, marking $x=3$ as a vertical asymptote.
- **Horizontal asymptote (at-infinity):** $\lim_{x\to\infty} \dfrac{3x^2-x}{2x^2+10}=\dfrac{3}{2}$ by leading coefficients; the graph approaches $y=\tfrac{3}{2}$.
- **Degree comparison (at-infinity):** For $\dfrac{x}{x^2-9}$, the denominator wins, so $\lim_{x\to\pm\infty} = 0$ even though a vertical asymptote occurs at $x=\pm3$.

## Mid-lesson checks
- Evaluate whether $\lim_{x\to4} \dfrac{|x-4|}{x-4}$ exists by comparing one-sided limits.
- Decide if any asymptote occurs for $f(x)=\dfrac{2x^2+1}{x^2+10}$ as $x\to -\infty$ and justify with dominant-term reasoning.
- Explain how infinite limits influence continuity classification at the affected point.

## Summary
- One-sided limits govern the existence of two-sided limits and detect jumps.
- Infinite limits describe divergence near vertical asymptotes, not finite values.
- Limits at infinity summarize global shape through dominant-term analysis, revealing horizontal asymptotes or divergence.

## Next steps
- Solidify these ideas with `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/lesson-03-exercises.mdx`.
- Continue to continuity in Lesson 4 to classify how these behaviors affect smoothness.
