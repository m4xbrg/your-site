# 1. Overview

This lesson introduces three central forms of **asymptotic behavior** in calculus:

- **One-sided limits:** approach from left or right only.  
- **Infinite limits:** function grows without bound near a point (vertical asymptotes).  
- **Limits at infinity:** behavior of a function as input grows unbounded  
  (horizontal asymptotes or unbounded growth).

Objectives:

- Distinguish left, right, and two-sided limits.  
```tex
- Interpret divergence to $ \pm\infty $.  
```
- Compute horizontal asymptotes via limits at infinity.  
- Connect asymptotic behavior to function graphs and continuity structure.

# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson

notation → one-sided → infinite-limits
limit-laws → limits-at-infinity

- One-sided limits refine limit direction.  
- Infinite limits describe unbounded vertical behavior.  
- Limits at infinity describe long-term horizontal behavior.

# 3. Core Exposition

## 3.1 One-sided limits

Definitions:

- Left-hand limit:
  $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = L.
```
$$

- Right-hand limit:
  $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = L.
```
$$

The two-sided limit exists exactly when both one-sided limits exist and are equal.

## 3.2 Infinite limits (vertical asymptotes)

If:
$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = +\infty
```
```tex
\quad\text{or}\quad
```
```tex
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = -\infty,
```
$$
then $ f(x) $ grows without bound as $ x $ approaches $ a $.

This signals a **vertical asymptote** at $ x=a $.

## 3.3 Limits at infinity (horizontal asymptotes)

A finite limit:
$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to \pm\infty} f(x) = L,
```
$$
means the graph approaches a horizontal line $ y=L $ as $ x $ grows unbounded.

Dominant-term reasoning for rational functions:
- If numerator degree < denominator degree → limit = 0  
- If degrees equal → ratio of leading coefficients  
```tex
- If numerator degree > denominator degree → limit diverges ($ \pm \infty $)
```

# 4. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — One-sided mismatch

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to0^-} \frac{|x|}{x} = -1,\qquad
```
```tex
\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{|x|}{x} = +1.
```
$$

Thus the two-sided limit does **not** exist.

---

### Example 2 — Infinite limit

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to 3} \frac{1}{x-3} = \pm\infty.
```
$$

```tex
Left side → $ -\infty $  
```
```tex
Right side → $ +\infty $
```

Vertical asymptote at $ x=3 $.

---

```tex
### Example 3 — Limit at $ \infty $
```

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{3x^2 - x}{2x^2 + 10}
```
```tex
= \frac{3}{2}.
```
$$

---

### Example 4 — Horizontal asymptote

$$
```tex
\lim_{x\to -\infty} \frac{5x - 1}{x + 7} = 5.
```
$$

# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis

- Infinite limits represent **divergence**, not existence. They encode direction of blow-up.  
- One-sided limits are necessary when the function changes structure at a point (piecewise, absolute value, rational functions).  
- Limits at infinity describe **global** behavior, but are computed using **local dominance patterns** (leading terms).  
- Vertical asymptotes reflect denominator zeros where the numerator doesn’t vanish simultaneously.  
- Horizontal asymptotes reflect stabilization of the ratio of dominant terms.

Invariants:

- A two-sided limit is determined entirely by its one-sided limits.  
- Infinite limits are always “essential” discontinuities.  
```tex
- Degree comparisons for rational functions are universally reliable for $ x\to\infty $.
```

# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)

### Tier A — foundational

1. Compute:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{1}{x}.
```
$$

2. Compute:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to -\infty} \frac{2x^2 + 1}{x^2 + 10}.
```
$$

---

### Tier B — mixed

3. Determine whether the limit exists:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to4} \frac{|x-4|}{x-4}.
```
$$

4. Identify any asymptotes of:
   $$
```tex
f(x)=\frac{x}{x^2 - 9}.
```
$$

---

### Tier C — challenge

5. Evaluate:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to\infty} \left( x\sin\frac{1}{x} \right).
```
$$

6. Determine:
   $$
```tex
\lim_{x\to 2^-} \frac{1}{(x-2)^3}.
```
$$

# 7. Summary

- One-sided limits refine directional behavior and determine two-sided limit existence.  
- Infinite limits capture blow-up near vertical asymptotes.  
- Limits at infinity describe global shape and horizontal asymptotes.  
- Dominant-term analysis simplifies rational expressions for large $ x $.  

Together, these are the asymptotic tools needed for continuity, derivative definitions, and curve analysis.
