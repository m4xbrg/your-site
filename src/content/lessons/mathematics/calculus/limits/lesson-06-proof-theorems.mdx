# Lesson Objectives
- **math-calculus-limits-epsilon-delta-proofs:** Construct $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proofs for basic limits using backward planning.
- **math-calculus-limits-squeeze-theorem:** Use bounding functions with matching limits to evaluate constrained expressions.
- **math-calculus-limits-ivt:** Apply continuity on closed intervals to guarantee the existence of roots or intermediate values.

## Setup
- Keep the formal definition from Lesson 5 visible; proofs will cite it directly.
- Review continuity criteria from Lesson 4 for IVT applications.
- Prepare scratch work for algebraic bounding and inequality manipulation.

## Concept recap
### math-calculus-limits-epsilon-delta-proofs — Proof pattern
Start from $|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$, express it in terms of $|x-a|$, choose $\delta$ to enforce the bound, and verify the implication.

### math-calculus-limits-squeeze-theorem — Bounding strategy
If $g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)$ near $a$ and both comparison limits equal $L$, then $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$.

### math-calculus-limits-ivt — Existence guarantee
For a function continuous on $[a,b]$, any value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ is attained somewhere in the interval.

## Worked examples
- **Linear $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proof (epsilon-delta-proofs):** For $\lim_{x\to2} (5x+1)=11$, pick $\delta=\varepsilon/5$ so $|5x+1-11|=5|x-2|<\varepsilon$ whenever $|x-2|<\delta$.
- **Squeeze with sine (squeeze-theorem):** Because $-1\le\sin\tfrac{1}{x}\le1$, multiplying by $x$ yields $-\tfrac{1}{|x|}\le x\sin\tfrac{1}{x}\le \tfrac{1}{|x|}$; both bounds approach $0$ as $x\to\infty$, so the squeezed limit is $0$.
- **IVT application (ivt):** If $f$ is continuous on $[1,4]$ with $f(1)=-2$ and $f(4)=5$, IVT ensures some $c\in(1,4)$ satisfies $f(c)=0$; the guarantee relies on interval continuity.

## Mid-lesson checks
- Outline the $\delta$ choice for proving $\lim_{x\to0} (3x^2)=0$ using the formal definition.
- Identify appropriate bounding functions to squeeze $\lim_{x\to0} x^2\cos\tfrac{1}{x}$.
- State the hypotheses of IVT and note what fails if continuity on $[a,b]$ is missing.

## Summary
- $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proofs operationalize the formal limit definition through explicit $\delta(\varepsilon)$ choices.
- The Squeeze Theorem converts bounding information into exact limits when direct evaluation is difficult.
- The Intermediate Value Theorem leverages continuity to guarantee existence results critical for root-finding and graph analysis.

## Next steps
- Complete `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/lesson-06-exercises.mdx` and the broader review set in `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/math-calculus-limits-review.mdx`.
- Use these tools as the foundation for derivative definitions and later calculus proofs.
