# 1. Overview

This final lesson unifies rigorous limit techniques with two fundamental
existence theorems. It extends the formal ε–δ definition into actual proofs and
shows how bounding arguments and continuity yield structural conclusions.

Objectives:

- Construct epsilon–delta proofs for simple limits.  
- Apply the Squeeze Theorem to evaluate constrained limits.  
- Use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to guarantee the existence of
  solutions.  
- Understand how these tools form the rigorous foundation for later calculus
  concepts such as derivatives and root-finding.

# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson

epsilon-delta-definition → epsilon-delta-proofs  
limit-laws → squeeze-theorem  
continuity-interval → ivt

- Epsilon–delta proofs apply the formal definition.  
- Squeeze uses bounding functions with matching limits.  
- IVT requires continuity on closed intervals.

# 3. Core Exposition

## 3.1 Epsilon–delta proof structure

To prove
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L,
$$
we must produce a δ for an arbitrary ε:

1. Start with $ |f(x)-L| < \varepsilon $.  
2. Express the left side in terms of $ |x-a| $.  
3. Bound auxiliary expressions (e.g., $ |x+1| $).  
4. Solve for δ in terms of ε.  
5. Verify:
$$
0<|x-a|<\delta \Rightarrow |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon
$$

This “backwards planning” is universal.

## 3.2 Squeeze Theorem

If
$$
g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x)
$$
near $ a $, and
$$
\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = \lim_{x\to a} h(x) = L,
$$
then
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
$$
Used when direct computation is impossible but bounding behavior is known.

---

## 3.3 Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)

If $ f $ is continuous on $ [a,b] $ and $ N $ lies between $ f(a) $ and $ f(b) $, then there exists $ c \in (a,b) $ with
$$
f(c)=N
$$

This is an **existence theorem**, not a computational tool.

Applications:
- roots of equations  
- sign changes  
- argument principles about crossings

# 4. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — ε–δ proof (linear function)

Prove:
$$
\lim_{x\to 1} (5x-3)=2
$$
Compute:
$$
|(5x-3) - 2| = 5|x-1|
$$
Choose $ \delta = \varepsilon/5 $. Verification is immediate.

---

### Example 2 — ε–δ proof (quadratic with bounding)

Goal:
$$
\lim_{x\to2} x^2 = 4
$$
Rewrite:
$$
|x^2-4| = |x-2||x+2|
$$
If $ |x-2|<1 $, then $ x \in (1,3) $ so $ |x+2|<5 $. Thus:
$$
|x^2-4| < 5|x-2|
$$
Pick:
$$
\delta = \min\{1, \varepsilon/5\}
$$

---

### Example 3 — Squeeze Theorem

Evaluate:
$$
\lim_{x\to0} x \sin(1/x)
$$
Bound:
$$
-|x| \le x\sin(1/x) \le |x|
$$
Both bounds → 0. Therefore the limit is 0.

---

### Example 4 — IVT: root existence

Show that
$$
x^3 - x - 1 = 0
$$
has a solution in (1,2).

Compute:
$$
f(1)=-1,\quad f(2)=5
$$
0 lies between −1 and 5 → IVT guarantees a root.

# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis

- Epsilon–delta proofs embody full rigor. Every proof reduces to manipulating
  inequalities and bounding factors.  
- Squeeze captures asymptotic confinement: if upper and lower bounds stabilize,
  the middle function must stabilize.  
- IVT is topological: continuity prevents skipping values and enforces existence
  of crossing points.

**Invariants**

- Limits proven via ε–δ are exact and do not rely on graphs or numeric
  evidence.  
- Squeeze is the default method for oscillatory or product-form limits.  
- IVT guarantees existence only — never location — of solutions.  
- All three tools integrate into the derivative definition in the next course.

# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)

### Tier A — foundational

1. Complete the ε–δ proof for
$$
\lim_{x\to3} (2x+1)=7
$$
2. Use Squeeze to show
$$
\lim_{x\to0} |x|\cos(1/x)=0
$$

### Tier B — mixed

3. Prove
$$
\lim_{x\to1} x^3 = 1
$$
by bounding $ |x^2 + x + 1| $.

4. Use IVT to explain why the equation
$$
e^x = 4
$$
has a solution.

### Tier C — challenge

5. For
$$
f(x)=x^2\sin(1/x),
$$
show the limit at 0 is 0 by bounding $ |\sin(1/x)| \le 1 $ and using
polynomial dominance.

6. Let
$$
f(x)=x^5-7x+1
$$
Show that it has at least one root and at most three real roots (use IVT +
monotonicity reasoning).

---

# 7. Summary

- Epsilon–delta proofs formalize limits through controlled tolerances.  
- Squeeze Theorem resolves bounded functions when direct computation fails.  
- IVT guarantees existence of intermediate values for continuous functions.  
- Together they complete the rigorous foundation for calculus, connecting limits
  to continuity and the derivative.
