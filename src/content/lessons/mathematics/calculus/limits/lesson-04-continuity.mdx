# Lesson Objectives
- **math-calculus-limits-continuity-point:** Test continuity at a point using limits and function values.
- **math-calculus-limits-continuity-interval:** Extend pointwise continuity to intervals and common function families.
- **math-calculus-limits-discontinuities-classification:** Differentiate removable, jump, and essential failures.
- **math-calculus-limits-removable-discontinuities:** Repair holes by redefining the function when a finite limit exists.

## Setup
- Keep results from one-sided and infinite limits (Lesson 3) ready for classifying discontinuities.
- Review algebraic simplifications that expose holes or asymptotes.
- Sketch paper helps visualize left/right behavior at candidate points.

## Concept recap
### math-calculus-limits-continuity-point — Local agreement
Continuity at $a$ requires $f(a)$ to exist, $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ to exist, and equality between them.

### math-calculus-limits-continuity-interval — Smoothness across regions
A function continuous at every interior point and with appropriate endpoint behavior is continuous on the interval; polynomials and trig functions satisfy this on their domains.

### math-calculus-limits-discontinuities-classification — Types of failure
- **Removable:** finite limit exists but the point value is missing or mismatched.
- **Jump:** left and right limits exist but disagree.
- **Essential:** no finite limit (including infinite or oscillatory blow-up).

### math-calculus-limits-removable-discontinuities — Fixable holes
When a finite limit exists, defining $f(a)$ to equal that limit restores continuity.

## Worked examples
- **Verifying continuity (continuity-point):** Polynomials like $f(x)=3x^2-1$ are continuous everywhere; substitution gives the limit at any point.
- **Removing a hole (removable-discontinuities):** $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}=x+3$ for $x\ne3$ has $\lim_{x\to3} f(x)=6$; defining $f(3)=6$ patches continuity.
- **Jump discontinuity (discontinuities-classification):** $f(x)=\begin{cases}1,&x<0\\5,&x\ge0\end{cases}$ has unequal one-sided limits at $0$, so no two-sided limit exists.
- **Essential infinite break (discontinuities-classification):** $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x-2}$ diverges to opposite infinities near $2$, creating an essential discontinuity and vertical asymptote.

## Mid-lesson checks
- Determine whether $\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}$ is continuous at $x=2$ and, if not, how to repair it.
- Classify the discontinuity of $f(x)=\dfrac{|x-1|}{x-1}$ at $x=1$ using one-sided limits.
- Identify all discontinuities of $f(x)=\dfrac{x}{x^2-1}$ and categorize each.

## Summary
- Continuity means the limit matches the function value; failures fall into removable, jump, or essential types.
- One-sided and infinite limits reveal the nature of each discontinuity.
- Removable discontinuities can often be patched, while jumps and essential breaks cannot be fixed by a single-point change.

## Next steps
- Apply these ideas in `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/lesson-04-exercises.mdx`.
- Prepare for Lesson 5, where continuity and limit ideas become fully formal through the epsilon–delta definition.
