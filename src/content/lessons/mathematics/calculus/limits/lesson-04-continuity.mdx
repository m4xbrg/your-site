# 1. Overview

This lesson formalizes **continuity** using limits and develops a precise
taxonomy of **discontinuities**. We analyze when a function behaves smoothly,
when it fails, and how those failures differ structurally.

Objectives:

- Apply limit-based definitions of continuity.  
- Distinguish continuity at a point vs. on an interval.  
- Classify removable, jump, and essential discontinuities.  
- Recognize when continuity can be “repaired.”

# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson

one-sided → discontinuities-classification → removable-discontinuities
notation → continuity-point → continuity-interval

- Continuity relies on limit existence and agreement with value.  
- Discontinuity classification depends on one-sided limits.  
- Removable discontinuities arise when the limit exists but the function value is defective.

# 3. Core Exposition

## 3.1 Continuity at a point

A function \( f \) is **continuous at \( a \)** if:

1. \( f(a) \) is defined,  
2. \( \lim_{x\to a} f(x) \) exists,  
3. and they agree:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a).
   \]

Continuity is a local condition tied directly to limit behavior.

---

## 3.2 Continuity on an interval

A function is **continuous on an interval** if it is continuous at:

- every interior point,  
- the right endpoint (for closed interval left side),  
- the left endpoint (for closed interval right side).

Polynomials, rational functions (nonzero denominators), exponential and
trigonometric functions are all continuous on their domains.

---

## 3.3 Classification of discontinuities

Three fundamental types:

### • Removable  
Finite limit exists, but value is missing or mismatched.

### • Jump  
Left and right limits exist but are unequal.

### • Essential  
Includes:
- infinite discontinuities (blow-up),  
- oscillatory discontinuities,  
- anything where no finite limit exists.

---

## 3.4 Removable discontinuities: structure

A removable discontinuity arises when:

\[
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L, \quad f(a) \ne L \text{ or } f(a) \text{ undefined.}
\]

Fix by defining:

\[
f(a) := L.
\]

# 4. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Confirming continuity

\[
f(x)=3x^2-1.
\]
Polynomials are continuous everywhere.  
Direct substitution gives the limit at any point.

---

### Example 2 — Removable discontinuity

\[
f(x)=\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}.
\]

Factor:
\[
f(x)=x+3,\quad x\ne3.
\]

Limit at 3 is 6, but function is undefined at 3 → removable.

---

### Example 3 — Jump discontinuity

\[
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
1,&x<0,\\
5,&x\ge0.
\end{cases}
\]

Left limit = 1, right limit = 5 → jump.

---

### Example 4 — Essential (infinite)

\[
f(x)=\frac{1}{x-2}.
\]

Left side → \( -\infty \), right side → \( +\infty \).  
No finite limit → essential discontinuity.

---

# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis

- Continuity represents “agreement” between the function’s definition and its
  limiting behavior.  
- Discontinuities reflect structural failures of this agreement.  
- Jump discontinuities cannot be repaired by modifying the function at a single
  point — the mismatch is directional.  
- Infinite discontinuities describe unbounded behavior, not missing values.  
- Continuous functions on closed intervals satisfy properties such as IVT and
  always attain maxima/minima (later).

### Invariants:

- Continuity at a point ⇔ limit exists and equals the function value.  
- Removable ⇔ finite limit exists but point value is wrong.  
- Jump ⇔ one-sided limits exist but differ.  
- Essential ⇔ cannot confine function within any small band near the point.

# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)

### Tier A — foundational

1. Determine whether  
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}
   \]
   is continuous at \( x=2 \).

2. Determine:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to1} \frac{|x-1|}{x-1}.
   \]

---

### Tier B — mixed

3. Classify the discontinuity of  
   \[
   f(x)=\begin{cases}
   x+1,&x\neq2,\\
   0,&x=2.
   \end{cases}
   \]

4. Determine all discontinuities of  
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{x}{x^2-1}.
   \]

---

### Tier C — challenge

5. A function oscillates increasingly near \( x=0 \), staying between −5 and 5.
   Does it have a removable, jump, or essential discontinuity?

6. A piecewise function satisfies
   \[
   \lim_{x\to4^-}f(x)=2,\quad \lim_{x\to4^+}f(x)=2,\quad f(4)=100.
   \]
   Identify the discontinuity and suggest a repair.

---

# 7. Summary

- Continuity formalizes the idea of unbroken function behavior.  
- Discontinuities appear when limit behavior and point values diverge.  
- Three distinct failures: removable, jump, essential.  
- Continuity and discontinuity classification are structural tools used heavily
  in derivative definitions, IVT applications, and deeper analysis.
