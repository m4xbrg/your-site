# 1. Overview

This lesson introduces the **algebraic rules** governing limits and the
**standard strategies** used to compute limits efficiently. It builds the
operational toolkit for evaluating limits of algebraic expressions.

Objectives:

- Use algebraic laws to compute limits symbolically.  
- Apply substitution, factoring, rationalization, and limit comparisons.  
- Recognize when algebraic manipulation is necessary.  
- Form the computational backbone for later continuity and derivative rules.

# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson

### Core relationships:
- `limit-laws` gives *rules* for combining known limits.  
- `computation-strategies` gives *methods* for resolving indeterminate expressions.

### Structural DAG:

informal-idea → notation → limit-laws  
limit-laws → computation-strategies

Algebraic laws require notation; strategies depend on applying the laws.

# 3. Core Exposition

## 3.1 Algebraic limit laws

For limits that exist, the following hold:

- **Sum:**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} (f+g)(x) = L_f + L_g.
$$

- **Difference:**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} (f-g)(x) = L_f - L_g.
$$

- **Product:**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x)g(x) = L_f L_g.
$$

- **Quotient:**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{L_f}{L_g},\quad L_g\ne 0.
$$

- **Power / polynomial laws**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} p(x) = p(a)
$$

- **Composition law (continuous outer function):**
$$
\lim_{x\to a} g(f(x)) = g(L_f).
$$

These laws allow replacing limits of expressions with expressions of limits.

## 3.2 Basic computation strategies

### Strategy 1 — Direct substitution  
Works when the function is continuous at the point.

### Strategy 2 — Factoring  
Used to remove removable discontinuities:
$$
\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = x+1.
$$

### Strategy 3 — Rationalization  
Used for radicals:
$$
\frac{\sqrt{x+1}-1}{x} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{x+1}+1}{\sqrt{x+1}+1}.
$$

### Strategy 4 — Common denominators / simplification  
Reduces complex rational functions into simpler ones.

### Strategy 5 — Dominant terms and comparisons  
Used when forms like $ \frac{1}{x} $ or polynomials appear near finite or infinite points.

# 4. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Direct substitution
$$
\lim_{x\to 3} (2x^2 - 5x + 1)
$$
$$
= 2(9) - 15 + 1 = 4
$$

### Example 2 — Factoring to remove a hole
$$
\lim_{x\to 1} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}
$$
$$
= \lim_{x\to1} (x+1)
$$
$$
= 2
$$

### Example 3 — Rationalization

Evaluate:
$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sqrt{x+1}-1}{x}
$$

Multiply by the conjugate:
$$
\frac{\sqrt{x+1}-1}{x}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{x+1}+1}{\sqrt{x+1}+1}
$$
$$
= \frac{x}{x(\sqrt{x+1}+1)}
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+1}+1}
$$

Thus the limit is:
$$
\frac{1}{2}
$$

### Example 4 — Quotient with discontinuity
$$
\lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x-2}
$$

Factor:
$$
\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2} = x+2
$$
Limit = 4.

# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis

- Algebraic manipulation changes the *expression*, not the underlying limit.  
- Removing removable discontinuities is legitimate because limit behavior depends on nearby values.  
- Rationalization resolves radicals by eliminating denominators that tend to zero.  
- Composition requires continuity of the outer function.  
- Many indeterminate expressions $ 0/0 $ are removable; $ 0/0 $ is a *signal*, not an outcome.  

Fundamental invariant:

> Limit laws operate on existing limits. Computation strategies produce forms where laws can be reapplied.

# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)

### Tier A — foundational
1. Compute:  
$$
\lim_{x\to5} (3x-7)
$$
2. Compute:  
$$
\lim_{x\to2} (x^3 + 4x)
$$

### Tier B — mixed
3. Evaluate:  
$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2-9x}{x}
$$
4. Evaluate:  
$$
\lim_{x\to1} \frac{x^3-1}{x-1}
$$

### Tier C — challenge
5. Evaluate using rationalization:  
$$
\lim_{x\to4} \frac{\sqrt{x}-2}{x-4}
$$
6. Evaluate using polynomial dominance:  
$$
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{3x^3 - x}{x^3 + 10}
$$
