# Lesson Objectives
- **math-calculus-limits-limit-laws:** Apply sum, product, quotient, and composition rules to reduce complex limits.
- **math-calculus-limits-computation-strategies:** Choose substitution, factoring, rationalization, or comparison to evaluate limits efficiently.

## Setup
- Refresh notation from Lesson 1 and keep the law list visible for reference.
- Have scratch paper for algebraic manipulation and factoring.
- Graphing support is helpful for checking answers but not required.

## Concept recap
### math-calculus-limits-limit-laws — Algebraic rules
Existing finite limits combine via arithmetic and composition, letting us swap “limit of expression” with “expression of limits.”

### math-calculus-limits-computation-strategies — Practical tools
Direct substitution works on continuous functions; when it fails, factoring, rationalizing, or simplifying dominant terms can remove indeterminate forms.

## Worked examples
- **Direct substitution (limit-laws):** $\lim_{x\to3} (2x^2-5x+1) = 2(9)-15+1=4$ by polynomial continuity.
- **Factoring a removable hole (computation-strategies):** $\lim_{x\to1} \dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to1} (x+1) = 2$ after canceling the common factor.
- **Rationalizing (computation-strategies):** $\lim_{x\to0} \dfrac{\sqrt{x+1}-1}{x}$ becomes $\lim_{x\to0} \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x+1}+1}=\dfrac{1}{2}$ after multiplying by the conjugate.
- **Dominant-term comparison (limit-laws + strategies):** $\lim_{x\to\infty} \dfrac{5x^2-3}{2x^2+1} = \dfrac{5}{2}$ by leading coefficients.

## Mid-lesson checks
- Decide whether direct substitution works for $\lim_{x\to2} \dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}$; if not, pick a strategy and justify.
- Explain why the quotient law requires a nonzero denominator limit and give a counterexample when it fails.
- Simplify a limit of your choice using two different strategies and compare which is cleaner.

## Summary
- Algebraic limit laws enable symbolic computation when individual component limits exist.
- Computation strategies remove indeterminate forms and reveal the conditions under which the laws apply.
- Dominant-term and substitution reasoning link the informal ideas from Lesson 1 to structured algebra.

## Next steps
- Reinforce the rules with `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/lesson-02-exercises.mdx`.
- Move to asymptotic behavior in Lesson 3 to study one-sided limits and asymptotes.
