# Lesson Objectives
- **math-calculus-limits-informal-idea:** Describe a limit as approach behavior rather than point evaluation.
- **math-calculus-limits-graphical-numerical:** Use tables and plots as evidence for a limit value.
- **math-calculus-limits-notation:** Read and write standard two-sided and one-sided limit notation.

## How to use this lesson
- Skim the concept cards above; each section below calls out the matching concept ID.
- Keep a calculator or graphing tool handy so you can generate nearby values and zoom into graphs.
- Focus on approach behavior first—algebraic shortcuts and proofs arrive in later lessons.

## Informal idea: approaching a value (math-calculus-limits-informal-idea)
A limit captures how $f(x)$ behaves **as $x$ gets close to** a target input $a$, even if $f(a)$ is different or undefined. The nearby trend matters more than the exact point.

- If outputs settle near a single number $L$ whenever $x$ is near $a$, we write $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$.
- Changing $f(a)$, filling a hole, or leaving $a$ undefined does not change the limit as long as the surrounding behavior stays the same.

### Guided example: hole but stable behavior
Let $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ for $x\neq1$. Near $x=1$, the outputs simplify to values near $2$ even though $f(1)$ is undefined. The approach behavior still gives $\lim_{x\to1} f(x)=2$ because nearby points crowd around height $2$.

### Quick checks
- Explain in your own words why the value of $f(a)$ is irrelevant when discussing $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$.
- Sketch a function with a missing point at $x=3$ but with $\lim_{x\to3} f(x)=5$.

## Graphical and numerical evidence (math-calculus-limits-graphical-numerical)
Graphs and tables let us see approach behavior without heavy algebra.

- **Tables:** Build values of $f(x)$ from both sides of $a$. If the outputs close in on the same number, that number is the likely limit.
- **Graphs:** Zoom near $x=a$ and watch whether the curve squeezes toward one height. If left and right sides head to different heights, the two-sided limit does not exist.

### Example: settling toward a height
For $f(x) = \dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$, a table at $0.9,0.99,1.01,1.1$ shows outputs clustering near $2$. On a graph, the curve approaches the hole at $(1,2)$ from both sides. Both pieces of evidence support $\lim_{x\to1} f(x)=2$.

### Quick checks
- Given a sketch where the left side approaches $7$ and the right side approaches $5$ as $x\to4$, decide whether $\lim_{x\to4} h(x)$ exists and justify.
- Build a tiny table around $x=0$ for $g(x)=\sin x / x$ and note whether the values appear to stabilize.

## Speaking in limit notation (math-calculus-limits-notation)
Limit notation compresses the informal idea into symbols.

- $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$ reads as “as $x$ approaches $a$, $f(x)$ approaches $L$.”
- One-sided notation, such as $\lim_{x\to a^-}$ and $\lim_{x\to a^+}$, highlights approaching from the left or right when the two sides might differ.
- Writing the statement does **not** assert anything about $f(a)$; it only records the nearby trend.

### Example: translating words to symbols
“The function nears $8$ as $x$ approaches $-1$ from the right” becomes $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -1^+} f(x)=8$. The arrow specifies the input approach, and the superscript $+$ marks the right-hand direction.

### Quick checks
- Rewrite the sentence “$f$ gets close to $3$ whenever $x$ is near $2$, even though $f(2)$ is undefined” using limit notation.
- Interpret the symbols $\lim_{x\to5} g(x)=1$ in a single, clear sentence about approach behavior.

## Summary
- A limit measures approach behavior near a point, independent of the function’s actual value there.
- Tables and graphs provide numerical and visual evidence for whether a limit settles to a single value.
- Standard limit notation records the trend (two-sided or one-sided) without claiming anything about $f(a)$.

## Next steps
- Practice with the aligned set in `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/lesson-01-exercises.mdx`.
- Move on to Lesson 2 for algebraic rules and computation strategies once these foundations feel solid.
