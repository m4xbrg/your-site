# Lesson Objectives
- **math-calculus-limits-informal-idea:** Describe a limit as approach behavior rather than point evaluation.
- **math-calculus-limits-graphical-numerical:** Interpret tables and plots as evidence for a limit value.
- **math-calculus-limits-notation:** Read and write standard two-sided and one-sided limit notation.

## Setup
- Recall how to evaluate and graph basic functions (polynomials, rationals) near a point.
- Have access to a calculator or plotting tool to generate nearby values.
- Keep the concept cards above handy; they anchor each activity.

## Concept recap
### math-calculus-limits-informal-idea — Approach behavior
Limits track how outputs behave **near** a target input, independent of the value at that input.

### math-calculus-limits-graphical-numerical — Evidence from data and graphs
Tables that close in on an input and graphs zoomed near the point both reveal whether values settle toward a single height.

### math-calculus-limits-notation — Symbolic language
Expressions like $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$ or $x\to a^\pm$ encode the same approach idea compactly.

## Worked examples
- **Numerical concentration (graphical-numerical):** For $f(x) = \dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$, values at $0.9,0.99,1.01,1.1$ cluster near $2$, so $\lim_{x\to1} f(x)=2$ even though $f(1)$ is undefined.
- **Graph with a hole (informal-idea + notation):** A curve missing the point $(3,5)$ but approaching height $5$ from both sides still satisfies $\lim_{x\to3} f(x)=5$.
- **Irrelevant point value (notation):** If $g(1)=1000$ but nearby values follow the same pattern as $f$ above, the limit remains $2$ because approach behavior dominates.

## Mid-lesson checks
- Using a quick table, estimate $\lim_{x\to2} (x^2-3x+5)$ and explain which concept card you relied on.
- On a sketch with $x\to4^-$ trending to $7$ and $x\to4^+$ trending to $5$, decide whether $\lim_{x\to4} h(x)$ exists.
- Translate “the function nears $8$ as $x$ approaches $-1$ from the right” into limit notation.

## Summary
- Limits capture approach behavior; the point’s actual value can differ or be undefined.
- Numerical tables and graphs provide informal but persuasive evidence for a limit.
- Standard notation communicates the same idea precisely and supports later algebraic rules.

## Next steps
- Practice with the aligned set in `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/lesson-01-exercises.mdx`.
- Preview limit laws and computation tools in Lesson 2, which extend these foundations.
