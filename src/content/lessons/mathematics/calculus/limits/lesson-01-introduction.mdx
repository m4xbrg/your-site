# 1. Overview

This lesson establishes intuition and foundational language for limits:

- What it means for a function to **approach** a value.  
- How numerical and graphical evidence support limit reasoning.  
- How to read and interpret standard limit notation.  

It prepares the formalism needed for algebraic limit rules and continuity.

# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson

**Concept relationships:**

- `informal-idea` → defines approaching behavior.  
- `graphical-numerical` → operationalizes the informal idea using tables/plots.  
- `notation` → encodes the concept precisely.

**Dependency chain:**

functions-basic → informal-idea
informal-idea → graphical-numerical
informal-idea → notation

# 3. Core Exposition

## 3.1 Informal meaning of a limit

A limit describes **behavior near** a point:
- We do not care about the value *at* the point (it may not even be defined).  
- We track what values the function produces when inputs are **close enough** to a target value.  

A stable target behavior suggests a single “approach value.”

## 3.2 Numerical evidence

If evaluating a function near \(a\) yields values concentrating near \(L\), we assert:

\[
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L.
\]

The pattern matters, not the exact function value at \(a\).

## 3.3 Graphical evidence

Graphs support the same idea:
- analyze the curve as it nears \(x=a\) from both sides,  
- observe whether the \(y\)-values converge to a single height.

## 3.4 Standard limit notation

Forms:

- \( \displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L \)  
- \( x \to a^- \) and \( x \to a^+ \) for one-sided limits  
- “\( f(x) \) tends to \( L \)” is verbal shorthand

Interpretation requires connecting notation back to behavior.

# 4. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Numerical concentration
Consider \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \).  
Table near \( x=1 \):

| x | f(x) |
|---|------|
|0.9|1.9|
|0.99|1.99|
|1.01|2.01|
|1.1|2.1|

Values cluster near 2 → \( \lim_{x\to1} f(x)=2 \).

### Example 2 — Graph-based inference
Given a plotted curve with a hole at \((3, 5)\), but approaching height 5 from both sides:  
\[
\lim_{x\to3} f(x)=5.
\]

### Example 3 — Irrelevant function value at point
Even if \( f(1) = 1000 \), as long as values near 1 approach 2, the limit is still 2.

---

# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis

- Limit behavior is strictly **local**; global properties of \(f\) do not matter.  
- The value at the limit point is functionally irrelevant to the limit.  
- Numerical tables must use values close enough to reveal a trend; coarse sampling can mislead.  
- Graphs can hide subtle oscillation—limits require stability, not appearance.  

**Key invariant:**  
Limits describe approach behavior, not pointwise equality.

---

# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)

### Tier A — foundational
1. Use a small numerical table to estimate \( \lim_{x\to2} (x^2 - 3x + 5) \).  
2. Based on a graph with a hole at \( x=4 \), estimate the limit from visual height.

### Tier B — mixed
3. Determine whether the limit exists as \( x\to0 \) for  
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{|x|}{x}.
   \]
4. Given values of \(f(x)\) near \(3\), argue whether they suggest a limit of 7.

### Tier C — challenge
5. Consider a function that oscillates between 1 and −1 with increasing frequency near \( x=0 \).  
   Discuss whether numerical/graphical evidence can reliably detect if a limit exists.

---

# 7. Summary

- Limits generalize “approach” behavior to arbitrary functions.  
- Numerical and graphical tools provide non-rigorous but useful evidence.  
- Standard notation expresses approach behavior symbolically.  
- This lesson provides the base layer for algebraic rules, continuity, and epsilon–delta formalism.

- Lesson 2: applying algebraic limit laws  
- Lesson 3: directional behavior + asymptotics  
- Lesson 4: foundations of continuity  
- Lesson 5: transition to formal epsilon–delta definition
