# Lesson Objectives
- **math-calculus-limits-epsilon-delta-definition:** Translate informal limit statements into formal $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ language and interpret the quantifiers.

## Setup
- Keep continuity examples from Lesson 4 nearby to see how limits govern point behavior.
- Review quantifier reading from logic (\(\forall\), \(\exists\)).
- Have scratch space for inequality manipulations when solving for $\delta$.

## Concept recap
### math-calculus-limits-epsilon-delta-definition — Formal limit statement
$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$ means: for **every** tolerance $\varepsilon>0$, there is a distance $\delta>0$ so that $0<|x-a|<\delta$ forces $|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$. Order matters: choose $\delta$ after seeing the requested $\varepsilon$.

## Worked examples
- **Reading the statement:** Rewrite “$f(x)$ approaches $3$ as $x\to2$” as: for any $\varepsilon>0$ pick $\delta=\min\{1,\varepsilon/5\}$ to guarantee $|f(x)-3|<\varepsilon$ when $|x-2|<\delta$.
- **Linear function (epsilon-delta-definition):** For $f(x)=4x-1$ at $x\to2$, choose $\delta=\varepsilon/4$ so $|f(x)-7|=4|x-2|<\varepsilon$.
- **One-sided variation:** For $x\to a^+$, replace $0<|x-a|<\delta$ with $a<x<a+\delta$; the rest of the structure is unchanged.

## Mid-lesson checks
- Given $f(x)=x^2$, propose a $\delta$ in terms of $\varepsilon$ near $x=1$ and justify briefly.
- Explain why the definition ignores the value of $f$ at $x=a$ itself.
- Describe how the $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ statement changes when discussing limits at infinity.

## Summary
- The $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definition encodes “arbitrarily close outputs require sufficiently close inputs.”
- Quantifier order (for every $\varepsilon$ there exists $\delta$) is essential for capturing robustness.
- Variants for one-sided limits and limits at infinity only modify the domain restriction.

## Next steps
- Practice formal translation and $\delta$ choices in `src/content/exercises/mathematics/calculus/limits/lesson-05-exercises.mdx`.
- Proceed to Lesson 6 to build full $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proofs and apply the Squeeze and Intermediate Value Theorems.
