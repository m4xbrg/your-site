# 1. Overview

This lesson introduces the **formal** definition of a limit using quantifiers,
tolerances, and neighborhoods. It provides a rigorous foundation for all
subsequent limit proofs, continuity arguments, and derivative definitions.

Objectives:

- Understand the roles of $ \varepsilon $ and $ \delta $.  
- Translate informal limit statements into ε–δ form.  
- Interpret the quantifier structure precisely.  
- Recognize how the definition encodes approach behavior.

# 2. Concept Map for This Lesson

informal-idea → notation → epsilon-delta-definition → epsilon-delta-proofs  
logic-quantifiers → epsilon-delta-definition

- Informal idea gives intuitive meaning.  
- Quantifiers give formal structure.  
- Epsilon–delta definition bridges intuition and formal analysis.

# 3. Core Exposition

## 3.1 Formal definition

We say:
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
$$
if:
$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0 :
$$
$$
0 < |x - a| < \delta \ \Rightarrow\ |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon
$$

### Components

- $ \varepsilon $: desired output accuracy.  
- $ \delta $: corresponding input restriction ensuring that accuracy.  
- $ 0<|x-a|<\delta $: focus on nearby values excluding the point.  
- Quantifier order: **∀ ε**, then **∃ δ**.

---

## 3.2 Structural interpretation

- The definition constrains function behavior without referencing the value at the point.  
- “For every ε” encodes arbitrary precision in the output.  
- “There exists δ” encodes control over the input region.  
- The definition formalizes stability: approaching a limit cannot be broken by local irregularities.

---

## 3.3 Equivalent forms

- Two-sided limit uses symmetric bands around $ a $.  
- One-sided limits modify the domain restriction:  
  For $ x \to a^- $: replace condition with $ a - \delta < x < a $.  
  For $ x \to a^+ $: replace with $ a < x < a + \delta $.  
- Limits at infinity use $ x > N $ or $ x < -N $ instead of $ |x-a|<\delta $.

# 4. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Simple translation to ε–δ form

Statement:
$$
\lim_{x\to 3} (4x - 1) = 11
$$
Rewrite:
- Given $ \varepsilon > 0 $, choose $ \delta = \varepsilon/4 $.  
- If $ 0<|x-3|<\delta $, then:
$$
|(4x-1) - 11| = 4|x-3| < 4\delta = \varepsilon
$$

### Example 2 — Constant function
$$
f(x)=5
$$
Then $ |f(x)-5| = 0 < \varepsilon $.  
Any $ \delta > 0 $ works.

### Example 3 — Quadratic example (pre-bounding)

Goal:
$$
\lim_{x\to1} x^2 = 1
$$
We rewrite:
$$
|x^2 - 1| = |x-1||x+1|
$$
To control $ |x+1| $, assume $ |x-1|<1 $, then $ x\in(0,2) $ so $ |x+1|<3 $.  
Thus:
$$
|x^2 - 1| < 3|x-1|
$$
Pick:
$$
\delta = \min\left\{ 1,\ \frac{\varepsilon}{3} \right\}
$$

### Example 4 — Why the value at the point is irrelevant

For
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
x^2,& x\ne 1,\\
1000,& x=1,
\end{cases}
$$
the ε–δ definition concerns only inputs satisfying $ 0<|x-1|<\delta $.  
The value at the point plays no role.

# 5. Deepening / Structural Analysis

- The key difficulty in ε–δ proofs is bounding auxiliary terms (e.g. $ x+1 $).  
- δ is almost always derived by solving the inequality backward from $ |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon $.  
- The definition encodes directional stability: limits are unique and cannot oscillate.  
- The value of the function at the limit point is never included; continuity is a later condition.

**Invariants**

- Limit definition is independent of pointwise value.  
- ε controls output precision; δ controls input proximity.  
- Quantifier order must not be reversed.

# 6. Practice Set (Tiered)

### Tier A — foundational

1. State the ε–δ definition for
$$
\lim_{x\to 4} (7x - 2) = 26
$$

2. Identify ε and δ roles in the definition.

### Tier B — mixed

3. Rewrite the limit
$$
\lim_{x\to -2} (5x+3)= -7
$$
in ε–δ form.

4. Explain why the ε–δ definition does not require evaluating $ f(a) $.

### Tier C — challenge

5. For
$$
\lim_{x\to1} x^2 = 1
$$
complete the bounding step that yields a δ of the form
$$
\delta = \min\{1,\varepsilon/3\}
$$

6. Show that if
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L_1
\quad\text{and}\quad
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L_2,
$$
then
$$
L_1 = L_2
$$
(Use the ε–δ definition.)

# 7. Summary

- The ε–δ definition formalizes what it means for a function to approach a value.  
- It is built on quantifiers, neighborhoods, and rigorous inequalities.  
- This structure underlies continuity, limit laws, and derivative definitions.  
- Epsilon–delta reasoning is the foundation of analysis.
