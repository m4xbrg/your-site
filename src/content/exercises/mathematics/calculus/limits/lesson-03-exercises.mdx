## Basic practice

1. **Right-hand approach** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^+} \dfrac{1}{x}$.

   **Solution.** As $x$ approaches $0$ from the right, $1/x$ grows without bound, so the one-sided limit is $+\infty$.

2. **Left-hand approach** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Determine $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^-} \dfrac{1}{x}$ and state the sign of the divergence.

   **Solution.** Approaching $0$ from the left makes $x$ negative and tiny, so $1/x$ heads to $-\infty$.

## Intermediate drills

3. **Vertical asymptote classification** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ For $f(x)=\dfrac{2}{(x-1)^2}$, compute $\lim_{x\to1^-} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to1^+} f(x)$. What kind of discontinuity occurs at $x=1$?

   **Solution.** The squared denominator stays positive while shrinking to $0$, so both one-sided limits are $+\infty$. The function has an infinite (essential) discontinuity with a vertical asymptote at $x=1$.

4. **End behavior** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Find $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to \infty} \dfrac{3x^2-5x+1}{x^2+2}$.

   **Solution.** Divide numerator and denominator by $x^2$: $\lim_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{3-5/x+1/x^2}{1+2/x^2}=3$. The horizontal asymptote is $y=3$.

## Conceptual insights

5. **Detecting limit failure** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Explain why $\lim_{x\to0} \dfrac{1}{x}$ does not exist, even though both one-sided limits exist.

   **Solution.** The left-hand limit is $-\infty$ and the right-hand limit is $+\infty$; because they disagree (and are unbounded), the two-sided limit fails to exist.

6. **Oscillatory behavior at infinity** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Consider $g(x)=\sin x$. Does $\lim_{x\to\infty} g(x)$ exist? Why or why not?

   **Solution.** No. $\sin x$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ without settling toward a single value, so the limit at infinity does not exist.

## Curveball challenge

7. **Piecewise one-sided check** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Let $h(x)=\begin{cases}\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}, & x<2, \\ x+5, & x\ge 2.\end{cases}$ Compute $\lim_{x\to2^-} h(x)$, $\lim_{x\to2^+} h(x)$, and decide whether $\lim_{x\to2} h(x)$ exists.

   **Solution.** For $x<2$, simplify $(x^2-4)/(x-2)=x+2$ so $\lim_{x\to2^-} h(x)=4$. For $x\ge2$, use $h(x)=x+5$, giving $\lim_{x\to2^+} h(x)=7$. The one-sided limits differ, so the two-sided limit does not exist (jump discontinuity).

8. **Asymptote from degree difference** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -\infty} \dfrac{5x^3+1}{2x^2-7}$ and describe the end-behavior asymptote.

   **Solution.** Highest power dominates; divide by $x^2$ to get $\lim_{x\to-\infty}\dfrac{5x+1/x^2}{2-7/x^2}$. As $x\to-\infty$, the expression behaves like $\dfrac{5x}{2}$, so the function grows without bound to $-\infty$ with an oblique asymptote $y=\tfrac52 x$.
