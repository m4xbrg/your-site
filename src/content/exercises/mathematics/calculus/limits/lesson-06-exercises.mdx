## Tier A – Foundational

1. Prove using ε–δ that:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 1} (2x+3) = 5.
   \]

2. Use the Squeeze Theorem to show:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 0} x\sin(1/x) = 0.
   \]

---

## Tier B – Mixed

3. For:
   \[
   f(x)=x^3,
   \]
   outline an ε–δ proof that:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 2} x^3 = 8.
   \]
   a. Factor \( x^3 - 8 \).  
   b. Show how to bound the factor that does not contain \( |x-2| \).  
   c. Choose an appropriate δ(ε).

4. Use IVT to show that:
   \[
   x^3 - x - 1 = 0
   \]
   has a solution in \( (1,2) \).

5. Let:
   \[
   g(x)=x^2\sin(1/x)
   \]
   for \( x\ne 0 \), and \( g(0)=0 \).  
   a. Use Squeeze to show \( \lim_{x\to 0} g(x)=0 \).  
   b. Conclude that \( g \) is continuous at 0.

---

## Tier C – Challenge

6. Let \( f \) be continuous on \([0,1]\) and suppose \( f(0)=-2 \), \( f(1)=5 \).  

   a. Use IVT to prove there is a point \( c\in(0,1) \) where \( f(c)=0 \).  
   b. Use IVT again to show there is a point \( d\in(0,1) \) where \( f(d)=1 \).  

7. Suppose:
   \[
   |f(x)| \le x^2 \quad \text{for all } x \text{ near } 0.
   \]
   a. Show using Squeeze that \( \lim_{x\to 0} f(x)=0 \).  
   b. Explain how this type of estimate is useful in derivative proofs later.
