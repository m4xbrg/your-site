## Basic practice

1. **Squeeze Theorem warm-up** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Given $-x^2 \le \sin x \le x^2$ for $x$ near $0$, use the Squeeze Theorem to show $\lim_{x\to0} x^2\sin x = 0$.

   **Solution.** Multiply the inequality by $x^2$ (nonnegative): $-x^4 \le x^2\sin x \le x^4$. Since $\lim_{x\to0} (-x^4)=\lim_{x\to0} x^4=0$, Squeeze Theorem yields $\lim_{x\to0} x^2\sin x=0$.

2. **Intermediate Value Theorem application** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Show that $f(x)=x^3-2$ has a root between $1$ and $2$.

   **Solution.** $f(1)=-1$ and $f(2)=6$ have opposite signs. $f$ is continuous (polynomial), so by IVT there exists $c\in(1,2)$ with $f(c)=0$.

## Intermediate drills

3. **Limit via algebra then proof** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Prove $\lim_{x\to3} (2x-5)=1$ with an epsilon–delta argument.

   **Solution.** $|(2x-5)-1|=2|x-3|$. Choose $\delta=\varepsilon/2$; then $|x-3|<\delta$ implies $|(2x-5)-1|<\varepsilon$, establishing the limit.

4. **Uniqueness of limits** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Explain why a function cannot have two different finite limits at the same point.

   **Solution.** Suppose $L_1\neq L_2$ are both limits at $a$. Choose $\varepsilon=|L_1-L_2|/3>0$. By the definition, there are $\delta_1,\delta_2$ such that values within both $\delta$-windows stay within $\varepsilon$ of each limit, forcing overlap where $f(x)$ is within $\varepsilon$ of both $L_1$ and $L_2$. This implies $|L_1-L_2|<2\varepsilon$, contradicting the choice of $\varepsilon$, so the limit must be unique.

## Conceptual insights

5. **Building a squeeze bound** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Describe a strategy for inventing upper and lower bounding functions when applying the Squeeze Theorem.

   **Solution.** Look for known inequalities (e.g., $-1\le \sin x\le1$) or absolute values to bound oscillatory parts, then multiply by nonnegative factors. Ensure both bounds share the same simple limit so the middle inherits it.

6. **Using continuity inside proofs** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ How does continuity simplify epsilon–delta proofs for composite functions?

   **Solution.** If inner and outer functions are continuous, one can replace the inner expression with its limit directly and rely on continuity to justify the outer limit, avoiding custom $\delta$ selections for each composition.

## Curveball challenge

7. **Two-stage squeeze** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Prove $\lim_{x\to0} x\sin(1/x)=0$ using a squeeze argument.

   **Solution.** Since $-1\le \sin(1/x)\le1$, multiplying by $x$ gives $-|x| \le x\sin(1/x) \le |x|$. Both bounds approach $0$ as $x\to0$, so by Squeeze Theorem the limit is $0$.

8. **IVT with parameters** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Let $g(x)=x^3-3x+k$ with $k\in\mathbb{R}$. Use IVT to find a condition on $k$ that guarantees at least one root in $(0,2)$.

   **Solution.** Evaluate $g(0)=k$ and $g(2)=8-6+k=2+k$. For a sign change, require $k$ and $2+k$ to have opposite signs: this occurs when $k<0<2+k$, i.e., $-2<k<0$. Continuity of the cubic then ensures a root in $(0,2)$.
