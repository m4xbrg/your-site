## Basic practice

1. **Continuity check** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Determine whether $f(x)=x^2+1$ is continuous at $x=0$.

   **Solution.** Polynomials are continuous everywhere. Substituting $x=0$ gives $f(0)=1$, matching the limit, so $f$ is continuous at $0$.

2. **Interval continuity** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ On what intervals is $g(x)=\dfrac{1}{x-3}$ continuous?

   **Solution.** The function is continuous wherever its denominator is nonzero: $(-\infty,3)$ and $(3,\infty)$.

## Intermediate drills

3. **Removable hole** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ For $h(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$, classify the discontinuity at $x=1$ and state $\lim_{x\to1} h(x)$.

   **Solution.** Factor to $\dfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}=x+1$ for $x\neq1$. The limit is $2$ and the discontinuity is removable (a hole) at $x=1$.

4. **Jump discontinuity** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Let $p(x)=\begin{cases}x+2,& x<0,\\ x^2,& x\ge0.\end{cases}$ Does $\lim_{x\to0} p(x)$ exist? Is $p$ continuous at $0$?

   **Solution.** $\lim_{x\to0^-}p(x)=2$ and $\lim_{x\to0^+}p(x)=0$. Since the one-sided limits differ, the two-sided limit fails and $p$ is not continuous at $0$ (jump discontinuity).

## Conceptual insights

5. **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Explain how IVT guarantees a root for a continuous function $f$ on $[a,b]$ when $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs.

   **Solution.** Continuity ensures $f$ takes all intermediate values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. If the signs differ, $0$ lies between them, so there is some $c\in(a,b)$ with $f(c)=0$.

6. **Patching continuity** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ How can defining $f(1)$ appropriately make $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ continuous at $x=1$?

   **Solution.** The limit at $1$ is $2$. Setting $f(1)=2$ fills the hole, aligning the value with the limit and restoring continuity at $x=1$.

## Curveball challenge

7. **Classifying mixed discontinuities** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ For $q(x)=\dfrac{x^2-9}{x^2-4}$, list all discontinuities and classify each.

   **Solution.** Factor: numerator $(x-3)(x+3)$, denominator $(x-2)(x+2)$. The function is undefined at $x=2$ and $x=-2$. No factors cancel, so both are non-removable infinite discontinuities (vertical asymptotes). Elsewhere the function is continuous.

8. **Continuous extension on an interval** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Define $r(x)=\begin{cases}\dfrac{\sin x}{x}, & x\neq0,\\ c, & x=0.\end{cases}$ Find $c$ so that $r$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

   **Solution.** $\lim_{x\to0}\dfrac{\sin x}{x}=1$, so choose $c=1$. With $r(0)=1$, the value matches the limit and the piecewise definition becomes continuous everywhere.
