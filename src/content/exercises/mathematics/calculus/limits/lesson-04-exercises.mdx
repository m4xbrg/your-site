## Tier A – Foundational

1. For:
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{x^2-4}{x-2},
   \]
   a. Is \( f(2) \) defined?  
   b. Does \( \lim_{x\to 2} f(x) \) exist?  
   c. Is \( f \) continuous at 2? Explain.

2. Let:
   \[
   g(x)=
   \begin{cases}
   x^2,& x\neq1,\\
   3,& x=1.
   \end{cases}
   \]
   a. Find \( \lim_{x\to1} g(x) \).  
   b. Is \( g \) continuous at 1? Why or why not?

## Tier B – Mixed

3. Classify the discontinuity at \( x=0 \) for:
   \[
   f(x)=
   \begin{cases}
   -1,& x<0,\\
   1,& x\ge0.
   \end{cases}
   \]
   a. Compute the left-hand and right-hand limits.  
   b. State the discontinuity type.

4. For:
   \[
   f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2},
   \]
   a. Determine the behavior near \( x=0 \).  
   b. Classify the discontinuity at 0 (removable, jump, or essential).  
   c. Is there any way to redefine \( f(0) \) to make \( f \) continuous at 0?

5. Let:
   \[
   h(x)=\sqrt{x}
   \]
   with domain \( [0,\infty) \).  
   a. Is \( h \) continuous at 0?  
   b. Explain using one-sided limits and the definition of continuity on a closed interval.

## Tier C – Challenge

6. Construct a function with **two** distinct discontinuities on \([-2,2]\):

   - One removable discontinuity at \( x=-1 \).  
   - One jump discontinuity at \( x=1 \).

   Give a piecewise formula and classify each discontinuity.

7. Suppose \( f \) is continuous on \([0,1)\) and at each point \( c\in[0,1) \) we have:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c).
   \]
   The function is undefined at \( x=1 \), but:
   \[
   \lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x) = 4.
   \]
   a. What value should \( f(1) \) be assigned to make \( f \) continuous on \([0,1]\)?  
   b. Describe the type of discontinuity at 1 before the redefinition.
