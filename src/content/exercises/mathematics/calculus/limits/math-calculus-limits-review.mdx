## Foundations & notation

1. **Graph vs. value** _(Difficulty: Basic; Tags: graphical, notation)._ A graph shows an open circle at $(-1,3)$ and a filled dot at $(-1,5)$. Estimate $\lim_{x\to-1} f(x)$ and $f(-1)$.

   **Solution.** The trend near $-1$ approaches height $3$, so $\lim_{x\to-1} f(x)=3$. The filled dot gives $f(-1)=5$. The mismatch signals a removable discontinuity.

2. **Limit language** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Tags: notation)._ Give a precise verbal statement for $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^+} g(x)=2$.

   **Solution.** For $x$ values sufficiently close to $0$ from the right (but not equal to $0$), $g(x)$ can be made as close to $2$ as desired.

## Algebraic fluency & continuity

3. **Factor to evaluate** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: limit laws, removable discontinuity)._ Compute $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to3} \dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}$ and describe the discontinuity of $h(x)=\dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}$.

   **Solution.** Factor to $(x-3)(x+3)/(x-3)=x+3$ for $x\neq3$. The limit is $6$. $h$ has a removable hole at $x=3$.

4. **Continuity decision** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: continuity, IVT)._ Is $p(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{x}-2}{x-4}$ continuous at $x=4$ after simplification? State the limit and the extended value that would make it continuous.

   **Solution.** Multiply by the conjugate to simplify to $1/(\sqrt{x}+2)$. The limit at $x=4$ is $1/4$. Defining $p(4)=1/4$ fills the hole and makes $p$ continuous there.

## One-sided, infinite, and end behavior

5. **One-sided asymptote** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: one-sided, infinite limits)._ Evaluate $\lim_{x\to1^-} \dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}$ and $\lim_{x\to1^+} \dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}$; classify the discontinuity.

   **Solution.** Both sides approach $+\infty$ because the squared denominator shrinks to $0^+$. There is a vertical asymptote (infinite discontinuity) at $x=1$.

6. **Limit at infinity** _(Difficulty: Basic; Tags: end behavior)._ Find $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -\infty} \dfrac{5x^2-3x+1}{x^2+4}$.

   **Solution.** Divide by $x^2$: $\lim_{x\to-\infty}\dfrac{5-3/x+1/x^2}{1+4/x^2}=5$. Horizontal asymptote $y=5$.

## Proof tools: epsilon–delta, squeeze, and theorems

7. **Epsilon–delta linear** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Tags: epsilon-delta)._ Provide $\delta$ in terms of $\varepsilon$ to prove $\lim_{x\to2}(4x-1)=7$.

   **Solution.** $|(4x-1)-7|=4|x-2|$. Choose $\delta=\varepsilon/4$ so $|x-2|<\delta$ guarantees $|(4x-1)-7|<\varepsilon$.

8. **Squeeze capstone** _(Difficulty: Curveball; Tags: squeeze theorem, oscillation)._ Prove $\lim_{x\to0} x\sin(1/x^2)=0$.

   **Solution.** Since $-1\le\sin(1/x^2)\le1$, multiplying by $x$ gives $-|x|\le x\sin(1/x^2)\le|x|$. Both bounds $\to0$ as $x\to0$, so the Squeeze Theorem yields the limit $0$.

9. **IVT with parameter** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Tags: IVT, continuity)._ For $f(x)=x^3-4x+k$, determine values of $k$ ensuring a root in $(1,2)$.

   **Solution.** Evaluate $f(1)= -3+k$ and $f(2)=8-8+k=k$. A sign change in $(1,2)$ requires $( -3+k)$ and $k$ to have opposite signs: $k<0$ and $-3+k>0$ or vice versa. The consistent interval is $0<k<3$, ensuring $f(1)<0<f(2)$ and a root by IVT.

## Conceptual synthesis curveballs

10. **Limit does not equal value** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Tags: continuity, notation)._ Explain with an example how a limit can exist while $f(a)$ is undefined.

    **Solution.** $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ is undefined at $x=1$, yet $\lim_{x\to1} f(x)=2$ after simplification. The limit reflects nearby behavior, independent of the missing point.

11. **Oscillation vs. divergence** _(Difficulty: Curveball; Tags: one-sided, infinite limits)._ Contrast $\lim_{x\to0} \dfrac{1}{x}$ with $\lim_{x\to0} \sin(1/x)$ in terms of existence and type of non-convergence.

    **Solution.** $1/x$ diverges to $\pm\infty$ with opposing one-sided limits, so the limit fails by unboundedness. $\sin(1/x)$ stays bounded but oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ infinitely often near $0$, preventing convergence to a single value.
