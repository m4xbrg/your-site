    prompt: >
      The graph of $f$ is shown (assume an appropriate graph is provided). Estimate
      $\lim_{x \to -1} f(x)$ and $f(-1)$, and explain whether they are equal.
    solution: >
      From the graph, as $x$ approaches $-1$ from both sides, the $y$-values approach
      some value $L$ (read from the graph). If the point at $x = -1$ is filled at a
      different height $f(-1) \neq L$, then $\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = L$ exists but
      $f(-1) \neq L$, so there is a removable discontinuity.

    prompt: >
      Compute $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} (3x^2 - 5x + 1)$ using limit laws.
    solution: >
      Using limit laws and continuity of polynomials,
      $$
      \lim_{x \to 2} (3x^2 - 5x + 1)
      = 3(2^2) - 5(2) + 1
      = 3 \cdot 4 - 10 + 1
      = 12 - 10 + 1 = 3.
      $$

    prompt: >
      Let $g(x) = \begin{cases}
      x^2 & x \neq 1, \\
      3 & x = 1.
      \end{cases}$
      Determine whether $g$ is continuous at $x = 1$.
    solution: >
      We have $\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = \lim_{x \to 1} x^2 = 1$, but $g(1) = 3$.
      Since the limit exists and is $1$ but $g(1) \neq 1$, $g$ is not continuous
      at $x=1$. This is a removable discontinuity.

    prompt: >
      Compute $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$.
      Explain your method and describe the type of discontinuity (if any)
      at $x = 2$ for the function $h(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$.
    solution: >
      Factor:
      $$
      \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} = \frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2} = x + 2, \quad x \neq 2.
      $$
      So
      $$
      \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} = \lim_{x \to 2} (x+2) = 4.
      $$
      The function $h$ has a hole at $x=2$ (removable discontinuity) since the
      simplified expression is defined there but the original is not.

      - math-calculus-limits-one-sided
    prompt: >
      Consider $\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-3)^2}$. Compute
      $\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x)$, $\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x)$, and classify the
      behavior at $x = 3$.
    solution: >
      As $x \to 3$, $(x-3)^2 \to 0^+$, so $\frac{1}{(x-3)^2} \to +\infty$ from
      both sides. Thus
      $$
      \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = +\infty.
      $$
      There is a vertical asymptote at $x=3$ and an infinite discontinuity there.

    topics:
      - math-calculus-limits-limits-at-infinity
    prompt: >
      Compute $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x^2 - x + 1}{x^2 + 3}$.
    solution: >
      Divide numerator and denominator by $x^2$:
      $$
      \frac{2 - \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2}}{1 + \frac{3}{x^2}} \xrightarrow[x\to\infty]{} \frac{2}{1} = 2.
      $$
      So the limit is $2$ and $y=2$ is a horizontal asymptote.

    topics:
      - math-calculus-limits-epsilon-delta-definition
      - math-calculus-limits-epsilon-delta-proofs
    prompt: >
      Using the $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definition of limit, prove that
      $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} (3x + 1) = 7$.
    solution: >
      We want: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
      $0 < |x-2| < \delta$ implies $|(3x+1) - 7| < \varepsilon$.
      Note that
      $$
      |(3x+1) - 7| = |3x - 6| = 3|x-2|.
      $$
      If we choose $\delta = \varepsilon/3$, then whenever $0 < |x-2| < \delta$
      we have
      $$
      |(3x+1)-7| = 3|x-2| < 3\delta = 3\cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{3} = \varepsilon.
      $$
      This proves the limit.

    prompt: >
      Show that $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0} x^2 \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 0$
      using the Squeeze Theorem.
    solution: >
      For all real $t$, $|\sin t| \le 1$, so
      $$
      -x^2 \le x^2 \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \le x^2
      $$
      for all $x \neq 0$. As $x \to 0$, both $-x^2$ and $x^2$ have limit $0$,
      so by the Squeeze Theorem the middle expression also has limit $0$.

    prompt: >
      Let $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$. Show that the equation $f(x) = 0$ has a solution
      in the interval $(1, 2)$.
    solution: >
      First compute $f(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1$ and $f(2) = 8 - 2 - 1 = 5$.
      Thus $f(1) < 0$ and $f(2) > 0$. The function $f$ is a polynomial, hence
      continuous on the closed interval $[1,2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem
      there exists $c \in (1,2)$ such that $f(c) = 0$. So the equation has
      at least one root in $(1,2)$.
