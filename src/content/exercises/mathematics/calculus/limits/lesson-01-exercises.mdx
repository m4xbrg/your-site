## Basic practice

1. **Table-based estimation** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Use the table to estimate $ \lim_{x\to 2} f(x) $. Explain why your answer is reasonable.

   | $x$   | $f(x)$ |
   |-------|--------|
   | 1.8   | 3.7    |
   | 1.9   | 3.9    |
   | 1.99  | 3.99   |
   | 2.01  | 4.01   |
   | 2.1   | 4.3    |

   **Solution.** The $f(x)$ values hover near $4$ as $x$ approaches $2$ from both sides, so $\lim_{x\to 2} f(x) = 4$. Because the nearby outputs stabilize around $4$ without jumping, the table supports the guess.

2. **Reading limit notation** _(Difficulty: Basic)._ Give a plain-language interpretation of $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -1} f(x)=4$.

   **Solution.** As $x$ gets closer to $-1$ (from either side) but is not exactly $-1$, the outputs $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to $4$; the limit describes the trend near $-1$, not necessarily the value at $x=-1$.

## Intermediate drills

3. **Comparing limit and function value** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ Suppose $\lim_{x\to 5} f(x)=2$ and $f(5)=100$. Which number is the limit and why can it differ from $f(5)$?

   **Solution.** The limit is $2$ because nearby values approach $2$ regardless of the jump at $x=5$. Limits depend on behavior around the point, so $f(5)$ can be anything without changing $\lim_{x\to 5} f(x)$.

4. **One-sided table read** _(Difficulty: Intermediate)._ A table shows the right-hand behavior of $g$ near $x=0$:

   | $x$   | $g(x)$ |
   |-------|--------|
   | 0.5   | 2.1    |
   | 0.2   | 2.02   |
   | 0.1   | 2.005  |
   | 0.01  | 2.0005 |

   Estimate $\lim_{x\to 0^+} g(x)$ and explain why this is different from $g(0)$.

   **Solution.** The outputs approach $2$, so $\lim_{x\to 0^+} g(x)=2$. The limit ignores the actual value at $0$; $g(0)$ could be undefined or different while the trend from the right still targets $2$.

## Conceptual insights

5. **Graph interpretation** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ A graph shows an open circle at $(3,6)$ and a filled point at $(3,2)$. What are $\lim_{x\to 3} f(x)$ and $f(3)$? Is $f$ continuous at $3$?

   **Solution.** The limit is $6$ because the curve approaches height $6$ from both sides. The function value is $f(3)=2$ (the filled point). Since the limit exists but differs from $f(3)$, $f$ is not continuous at $3$; the gap is removable.

6. **Neighborhood language** _(Difficulty: Conceptual)._ Describe what it means to say “for all $x$ in a small neighborhood of $a$, but $x\neq a$, the values $f(x)$ are close to $L$.”

   **Solution.** It means that if we pick $x$ values sufficiently near $a$ (excluding $a$ itself), the outputs cluster near $L$. This captures the intuitive idea of a limit without requiring that $f(a)$ equals $L$ or is even defined.

## Curveball challenge

7. **Ambiguous numeric evidence** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ You observe

   | $x$     | $f(x)$ |
   |---------|--------|
   | 0.1     | 0.84   |
   | 0.01    | 0.91   |
   | 0.001   | 0.88   |
   | 0.0001  | 0.93   |

   Discuss the difficulty in deciding whether $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)$ exists and what additional information would help.

   **Solution.** The outputs wobble rather than settling, so the table alone cannot confirm convergence. More precision (smaller $|x|$), one-sided checks, or a graph/algebraic form could reveal whether values stabilize to a single number or oscillate.

8. **Design a function with a hole** _(Difficulty: Curveball)._ Construct an explicit $f$ such that $\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)=3$ while $f(1)$ is undefined and the graph has a single hole at $x=1$.

   **Solution.** Let $f(x)=\dfrac{3(x-1)}{x-1}=3$ for $x\neq 1$ and leave $f(1)$ undefined. For all $x\neq1$, $f(x)=3$, so the limit is $3$; the missing point at $x=1$ creates the hole.
