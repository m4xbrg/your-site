## Informal idea: approach behavior

1. **When the point value does not matter** _(Difficulty: Basic; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-informal-idea)._ Suppose $\lim_{x\to 5} f(x)=3$ but $f(5)=20$. Which number captures the local trend near $x=5$, and why can it differ from $f(5)$?

   **Solution.** The limit is $3$ because nearby values approach $3$ regardless of what happens exactly at $x=5$. Limits summarize approach behavior, so $f(5)$ can be any value (or undefined) without changing $\lim_{x\to5} f(x)$.

2. **Filling a hole** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-informal-idea)._ For $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}$ with $f(3)$ undefined, use the surrounding behavior to decide $\lim_{x\to3} f(x)$. Briefly justify using the idea of approaching rather than plugging in.

   **Solution.** For $x\neq3$, $f(x)=x+3$, so nearby points crowd around $6$. Because the limit depends on the trend as $x$ approaches $3$, $\lim_{x\to3} f(x)=6$ even though the original formula leaves a hole at $x=3$.

3. **Mismatched approach directions** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-informal-idea)._ A sketch shows $h(x)$ approaching $1$ from the left of $x=0$ but approaching $-2$ from the right. Does $\lim_{x\to0} h(x)$ exist? Explain in terms of approach behavior.

   **Solution.** The two sides approach different heights, so there is no single value the function settles toward near $x=0$. Because a two-sided limit requires both directions to agree, $\lim_{x\to0} h(x)$ does not exist.

## Graphical and numerical evidence

4. **Table-based estimation** _(Difficulty: Basic; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-graphical-numerical)._ Use the table to estimate $\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)$ and describe why the table supports your conclusion.

   | $x$   | $f(x)$ |
   |-------|--------|
   | 1.8   | 3.7    |
   | 1.9   | 3.9    |
   | 1.99  | 3.99   |
   | 2.01  | 4.01   |
   | 2.1   | 4.3    |

   **Solution.** The values from both sides cluster near $4$. Because the outputs stabilize around $4$ without jumping, the table indicates $\lim_{x\to2} f(x)=4$.

5. **Reading a hole on a graph** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-graphical-numerical)._ A graph shows an open circle at $(3,6)$ and a filled point at $(3,2)$. What are $\lim_{x\to 3} f(x)$ and $f(3)$? Is $f$ continuous at $3$?

   **Solution.** The curve approaches height $6$ from both sides, so $\lim_{x\to3} f(x)=6$. The filled point gives $f(3)=2$. Because the limit and value differ, $f$ is not continuous at $3$; the hole could be filled with $6$ to fix it.

6. **Ambiguous numeric evidence** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-graphical-numerical)._ You observe the table

   | $x$     | $f(x)$ |
   |---------|--------|
   | 0.1     | 0.84   |
   | 0.01    | 0.91   |
   | 0.001   | 0.88   |
   | 0.0001  | 0.93   |

   Discuss whether the data alone confirms a limit at $x=0$ and what additional evidence would help.

   **Solution.** The outputs wobble instead of settling to a single number, so the table by itself cannot confirm a limit. More precise values, one-sided checks, or a graph could reveal whether the outputs eventually stabilize or keep oscillating, clarifying whether a limit exists.

## Limit notation and communication

7. **Interpreting a statement** _(Difficulty: Basic; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-notation)._ Give a plain-language description of $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -1} f(x)=4$.

   **Solution.** As $x$ gets close to $-1$ from either side (but is not exactly $-1$), the outputs $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to $4$. The equation records the nearby trend, not necessarily the value at $x=-1$.

8. **Writing the right symbols** _(Difficulty: Intermediate; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-notation)._ Translate “the function nears $8$ as $x$ approaches $-1$ from the right” into limit notation and explain what the arrow and superscript communicate.

   **Solution.** Write $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -1^+} f(x)=8$. The arrow signals that inputs move toward $-1$, and the $+$ superscript marks that the approach is from the right-hand side.

9. **Detecting a notation mistake** _(Difficulty: Conceptual; Concepts: math-calculus-limits-notation)._ A student writes $\lim_{x\to3} g(x)=g(3)$ because the function is “heading toward the point on the graph.” Why is this incorrect in general, and what should the limit statement actually claim?

   **Solution.** A limit only describes nearby behavior; $g(3)$ could differ or be undefined. The correct claim is $\lim_{x\to3} g(x)=L$ for the value $L$ that surrounding points approach. Equality with $g(3)$ holds only if the function happens to be continuous at $3$.
