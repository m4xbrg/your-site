## Tier A – Foundational

1. **Table-based estimation (basic).**  
```tex
   Use the table to estimate $ \lim_{x\to 2} f(x) $.
```

   | x    | f(x) |
   |------|------|
   | 1.8  | 3.7  |
   | 1.9  | 3.9  |
   | 1.99 | 3.99 |
   | 2.01 | 4.01 |
   | 2.1  | 4.3  |

   a. What number do the values of $ f(x) $ appear to approach?  
   b. Explain in words why this suggests a limit.

2. **Value vs limit.**  
```tex
   Suppose $ \lim_{x\to 5} f(x)=2 $ and $ f(5)=100 $.  
```
   a. Which number is the limit?  
   b. Does changing $ f(5) $ to 7 change the limit? Justify.

3. **Reading notation.**  
   Write a precise verbal interpretation of:

```tex
   a. $ \displaystyle \lim_{x\to -1} f(x)=4 $  
```
```tex
   b. $ \displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^+} g(x)=3 $
```

## Tier B – Mixed

4. **Graph interpretation.**  
```tex
   A graph shows a curve approaching height 6 as $ x\to 3 $, with an open circle at $ (3,6) $ and a filled dot at $ (3,2) $.
```

```tex
   a. What is $ \lim_{x\to 3} f(x) $?  
```
   b. What is $ f(3) $?  
   c. Is $ f $ continuous at 3? Explain briefly.

5. **Does the limit exist?**  
   Consider:
   $$
```tex
f(x)=\frac{|x|}{x} \quad (x\ne 0).
```
$$

```tex
   a. Describe the behavior of $ f(x) $ as $ x\to 0^- $ and as $ x\to 0^+ $.  
```
```tex
   b. Does $ \lim_{x\to 0} f(x) $ exist? Why or why not?
```

6. **Neighborhood language.**  
```tex
   Explain what it means to say “for all $ x $ in a small neighborhood of $ a $, but $ x\neq a $, the values $ f(x) $ are close to $ L $.”  
```
   Relate this to the informal notion of limit.

## Tier C – Challenge

7. **Ambiguous numeric evidence.**  
   You observe the values:

   | x      | f(x)  |
   |--------|-------|
   | 0.1    | 0.84  |
   | 0.01   | 0.91  |
   | 0.001  | 0.88  |
   | 0.0001 | 0.93  |

```tex
   a. What difficulties arise in deciding whether $ \lim_{x\to 0} f(x) $ exists?  
```
   b. Suggest what additional information would be needed.

8. **Design a function.**  
   Construct an explicit function $ f $ such that:

```tex
   - $ \lim_{x\to 1} f(x) = 3 $,  
```
   - $ f(1) $ is undefined,  
   - the graph has a single “hole” at $ x=1 $.

   Give a formula and explain why your function meets the conditions.
