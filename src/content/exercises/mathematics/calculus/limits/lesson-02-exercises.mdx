## Tier A – Foundational

1. Compute:

$$
\lim_{x\to 2} (3x^2 - x + 4).
$$

2. Compute:

$$
\lim_{x\to -1} (5x - 7).
$$

3. Using limit laws and direct substitution, evaluate:

$$
\lim_{x\to 0} (2x^3 + 7x).
$$

## Tier B – Mixed

4. Evaluate:

$$
\lim_{x\to 3} \frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}.
$$

   a. Show the algebraic step used to remove the discontinuity.  
   b. Explain why the limit is unaffected by canceling the factor.

5. Evaluate:

$$
\lim_{x\to 4} \frac{\sqrt{x} - 2}{x - 4}.
$$

   Use rationalization and show each step.

6. Evaluate:

$$
\lim_{x\to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 - x}.
$$

   Carefully factor and simplify before taking the limit. State any domain restrictions.

## Tier C – Challenge

7. Compute:

$$
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2 - 5x}{x}.
$$

   Explain why direct substitution fails initially and how simplification resolves it.

8. Let:

$$
f(x) = \frac{2x^2 + 3x - 2}{x^2 - 1}.
$$

   a. Find all points where $ f $ is not defined.  
   b. For each such point, determine whether the limit exists.  
   c. Identify any removable discontinuities and show the simplified expression used for limits.
