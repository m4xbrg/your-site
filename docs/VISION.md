# Vision

This project aims to build a **universal knowledge graph**, with pedagogy layered on top of it.

The core idea:
- Knowledge should be **conceptual, structured, and independent of teaching method**.  
- Pedagogy should be **modular, replaceable, and audience-specific**.

Through this architecture, the system can scale to *all human knowledge*, not only mathematics.

# 1. Why a Knowledge Graph?

Traditional curriculum is shaped by:
- historical accidents  
- institutional constraints  
- pedagogical habits  
- human biases  

This project restructures knowledge in a way that:
- is explicit and queryable  
- separates truth from instruction  
- supports multiple learning paths  
- adapts naturally to AI-assisted exploration

Concepts form the backbone of this graph.

# 2. Long-Term Architecture

1. **Knowledge Layer**
   - Subjects  
   - Macro-courses  
   - Courses  
   - Concepts  
   → an ontology of ideas

2. **Pedagogy Layer**
   - Lessons  
   - Exercises  
   - Notes  
   → multiple ways to traverse the graph

3. **Graph Tools**
   - validation, queries, coverage checks  
   - prerequisite reasoning  
   - concept density analysis  

4. **AI Integration**
   - automated content generation  
   - dynamic learning paths  
   - mastery models  
   - cross-domain reasoning

# 3. Scaling Beyond Mathematics

The architecture is domain-agnostic.

Concept graphs can be built for:
- physics (laws, principles, models)  
- chemistry (reactions, structures)  
- biology (systems, processes)  
- computer science (algorithms, patterns)  
- history (events, causes, structures)  
- literature (themes, forms, devices)  
- languages (grammar, phonology, syntax)  
- philosophy (arguments, distinctions)  

Lessons and exercises become replaceable views, not the backbone.

# 4. The Limits Course as a Reference Implementation

The calculus limits vertical demonstrates:
- concept-first design  
- densely structured relationships  
- lessons and exercises built on concepts  
- metadata richness (role, difficulty, kind, proofLevel)  
- consistent naming and schema conventions  
- graph-aware pedagogy  

It is the model for all future courses.

---

# 5. Future Outcome

A system where:
- concepts form the universal backbone  
- pedagogy is layered, modular, and optional  
- the graph spans all subjects  
- AI can reason over the entire structure  
- learners can follow personalized or domain-spanning paths  

This creates a durable, extensible, bias-resistant representation of human knowledge.
